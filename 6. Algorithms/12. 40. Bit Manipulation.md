### The Fundamental Bitwise Operators

These operators work on numbers at the level of their individual bits. Let's use `a = 5` (binary `0101`) and `b = 3` (binary `0011`) for our examples.

| Operator | Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                     | Example (`a` op `b`)                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`&`**  | **AND**                | Compares two bits and returns `1` only if **both** bits are `1`.                                                                                                                | `0101 & 0011 = 0001` (decimal 1)                                                         |
| **\|**   | **OR**                 | Compares two bits and returns `1` if **at least one** of the bits is `1`.                                                                                                       | `0101 \| 0011 = 0111` (decimal 7)                                                        |
| **`^`**  | **XOR** (Exclusive OR) | Compares two bits and returns `1` only if the bits are **different**.                                                                                                           | `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110` (decimal 6)                                                         |
| **`~`**  | **NOT** (Complement)   | Flips all the bits of a single number (`0` becomes `1`, `1` becomes `0`).                                                                                                       | `~0101` becomes `...11111010` (a negative number due to two's complement representation) |
| **`<<`** | **Left Shift**         | Shifts all bits of a number to the left by a specified amount, filling the new rightmost bits with `0`s. This is equivalent to multiplying by 2k.                               | `0101 << 1` becomes `1010` (decimal 10)                                                  |
| **`>>`** | **Right Shift**        | Shifts all bits of a number to the right by a specified amount. For positive numbers, the new leftmost bits are filled with `0`s. This is equivalent to integer division by 2k. | `0101 >> 1` becomes `0010` (decimal 2)                                                   |

### Common Bit Manipulation Patterns & Solutions

Here are some of the most useful patterns you'll encounter in interviews and competitive programming.

#### Pattern 1: Checking, Setting, and Clearing the i-th Bit

This is the most fundamental pattern, used for tracking flags or states within a single integer. The key is creating a "mask" that has a `1` only at the position you care about.

- **To create a mask for the i-th bit:** `mask = 1 << i`
    

**Logic and Code:**

Python

```python
# Let's say our number is num = 10 (binary 1010)
# and we want to work with the 1st bit (i=1).
num = 10  # 1010
i = 1
mask = 1 << i # 0010

# --- 1. Check if the i-th bit is set ---
# Logic: ANDing with the mask will result in a non-zero value
# only if the bit at that position was 1.
is_set = (num & mask) != 0
print(f"Is bit {i} set in {num}? {is_set}") # Output: True

# --- 2. Set the i-th bit (turn it on) ---
# Logic: ORing with the mask will turn on the bit at that
# position without affecting any other bits.
set_num = num | mask
print(f"Setting bit {i} in {num}: {set_num}") # 1010 | 0010 = 1010 (10)

# --- 3. Clear the i-th bit (turn it off) ---
# Logic: First, create a mask with a 0 at the i-th position
# by inverting the original mask (~mask). Then AND with it.
clear_mask = ~mask # ...11111101
cleared_num = num & clear_mask
print(f"Clearing bit {i} in {num}: {cleared_num}") # 1010 & ...1101 = 1000 (8)
```

#### Pattern 2: Finding the Single Non-Repeated Number

This pattern leverages the two crucial properties of the XOR (`^`) operator:

1. `x ^ x = 0` (XORing a number with itself results in zero).
    
2. `x ^ 0 = x` (XORing a number with zero results in the number itself).
    

**Problem:** [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/) - Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Logic Explanation:

If you XOR all the numbers in the array together, every number that appears twice will cancel itself out (a ^ a = 0, b ^ b = 0, etc.). The only number left at the end of the chain of XOR operations will be the one that appeared only once, because it was never canceled.

**Code Solution:**

Python

```python
def singleNumber(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Finds the single element that appears only once in an array
    where every other element appears twice.
    """
    # Initialize a variable to 0. XORing with 0 doesn't change the number.
    unique_num = 0
    
    # XOR all the numbers in the list together.
    for num in nums:
        unique_num ^= num
        # Example trace for [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]:
        # unique_num starts at 0
        # 0 ^ 4 = 4
        # 4 ^ 1 = 5
        # 5 ^ 2 = 7
        # 7 ^ 1 = 6 (which is 4 ^ 2)
        # 6 ^ 2 = 4 (which is 4 ^ 0)
    
    return unique_num

# print(singleNumber([4, 1, 2, 1, 2])) # Output: 4
```

#### Pattern 3: Counting Set Bits (Hamming Weight)

This pattern is used to efficiently count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of an integer.

**Problem:** [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/) - Write a function that takes an integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has.

Logic Explanation:

The naive way is to loop 32 times, checking each bit with a mask. A much more clever trick is to use the expression n & (n - 1). This operation flips the least significant '1' bit of n to a 0.

- Example: `n = 12` (binary `1100`).
    
- `n - 1 = 11` (binary `1011`).
    
- `n & (n - 1)` = `1100 & 1011` = `1000` (binary 8).
    
- Notice the rightmost `1` in `1100` was turned off.
    

By repeatedly applying this operation until the number becomes 0, you can count exactly how many `1` bits there were. The number of times you can do this is the number of set bits.

**Code Solution:**

Python

```python
def hammingWeight(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Counts the number of set bits (1s) in an integer's binary representation.
    """
    count = 0
    while n != 0:
        # This operation flips the least significant 1-bit to 0.
        n = n & (n - 1)
        
        # We increment the count for each 1-bit we turn off.
        count += 1
        
    return count

# print(hammingWeight(11)) # 1011 has 3 set bits. Output: 3
```
