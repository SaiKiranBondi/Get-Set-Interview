## 32. Segment Trees

A Segment Tree is a versatile and powerful binary tree data structure used for handling range queries and range updates efficiently. Each node in the tree represents an interval or "segment" of an array.

### The Core Idea

1. **Structure:** The root of the tree represents the entire array (`[0...n-1]`). Each internal node represents the union of its children's intervals. The left child represents the first half of the parent's interval, and the right child represents the second half. The leaves represent the individual elements of the array.
    
2. **Queries (e.g., Range Sum/Min/Max):** To find the sum of a range `[i...j]`, you traverse the tree. If a node's interval is completely contained within `[i...j]`, you use its pre-computed value. If it partially overlaps, you recurse on its children. This is much faster than iterating through the array.
    
3. **Updates:** When you update an element at index `i`, you update the corresponding leaf and then travel up the tree to the root, updating the value of all its ancestors.
    
4. **Lazy Propagation:** This is a crucial optimization for **range updates** (e.g., "add 5 to all elements from index `i` to `j`"). Instead of updating every leaf, you mark a high-level node with a "pending" or "lazy" update. This update is only pushed down to its children when a query or another update requires accessing those children.
    

### Visual Diagram (Segment Tree for Range Sum)

**Array:** `[1, 3, 5, 7]`

```
              [0-3] Sum=16
              /          \
      [0-1] Sum=4         [2-3] Sum=12
      /      \            /      \
 [0] Sum=1  [1] Sum=3  [2] Sum=5  [3] Sum=7
```

**Query for sum of range `[1-3]`:**

1. Start at root `[0-3]`. The query range `[1-3]` overlaps. Recurse.
    
2. Go left to `[0-1]`. Query `[1-3]` partially overlaps. Recurse.
    
    - Go left to `[0]`. No overlap. Return 0.
        
    - Go right to `[1]`. Full overlap. Return its value, `3`.
        
3. Go right to `[2-3]`. Query `[1-3]` fully contains this node's range. Return its value, `12`.
    
4. Total sum = `0 + 3 + 12 = 15`. (Incorrect trace, let's fix)
    

**Corrected Query Trace for sum of range `[1-3]`:**

1. Start at root `[0-3]`. Range `[1-3]` overlaps. Recurse on both children.
    
2. Go to left child `[0-1]`. Range `[1-3]` overlaps. Recurse on both its children.
    
    - Go to its left child `[0]`. No overlap with `[1-3]`. Return 0.
        
    - Go to its right child `[1]`. Full overlap with `[1-3]`. Return value `3`.
        
3. Go to right child `[2-3]`. Range `[1-3]` overlaps. Recurse on both its children.
    
    - Go to its left child `[2]`. Full overlap with `[1-3]`. Return value `5`.
        
    - Go to its right child `[3]`. Full overlap with `[1-3]`. Return value `7`.
        
4. The results bubble up. The final sum is `3 + 5 + 7 = 15`. (This is still inefficient, the power comes from full overlaps higher up).
    

**Let's try query `[0-2]`:**

1. Root `[0-3]` -> Recurse.
    
2. Left child `[0-1]`. Full overlap with `[0-2]`. Return its value `4`.
    
3. Right child `[2-3]`. Partial overlap. Recurse.
    
    - Left child `[2]`. Full overlap. Return `5`.
        
    - Right child `[3]`. No overlap. Return `0`.
        
4. Total sum = `4 + 5 = 9`. This is much faster.

        self.tree = [0] * (2 * self.n)

            if r % 2 == 0:
                res += self.tree[r]
                r -= 1
            l //= 2
            r //= 2
        return res
```

## 33. Fenwick Tree / Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)

A Fenwick Tree, or BIT, is another data structure for efficient point updates and prefix sum queries. It is often preferred over a Segment Tree for prefix sum problems because it requires significantly less code and less space, while offering the same time complexity for these specific operations.

### The Core Idea

A BIT is an array where each index `i` is responsible for storing the sum of a specific range of the original array. The magic is how this range is determined: by the binary representation of `i`. An `update` at index `i` traverses "up" the tree by adding the last set bit of `i`. A `query` for the sum up to `i` traverses "down" by subtracting the last set bit.

- `i & -i`: This bitwise trick isolates the last set bit of `i`.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

BIT (1-indexed):

- `BIT[1]` stores `sum(1)`
    
- `BIT[2]` stores `sum(1-2)`
    
- `BIT[3]` stores `sum(3)`
    
- `BIT[4]` stores `sum(1-4)`
    
- ...and so on.
    

**Trace `update(index=3, value=5)`:**

1. Start at `i = 3+1 = 4`. `update(4, 5)`.
    
2. `i = 4`. `BIT[4] += 5`. Next `i = 4 + (4 & -4) = 4 + 4 = 8`.
    
3. `i = 8`. `BIT[8] += 5`. Next `i = 8 + (8 & -8) = 8 + 8 = 16`. (Stop)
    

**Trace `query(index=5)` (sum of first 6 elements):**

1. Start at `i = 5+1 = 6`. `sum = 0`.
    
2. `i = 6`. `sum += BIT[6]`. Next `i = 6 - (6 & -6) = 6 - 2 = 4`.
    
3. `i = 4`. `sum += BIT[4]`. Next `i = 4 - (4 & -4) = 4 - 4 = 0`. (Stop)
    
4. Return `sum`.
    

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:**
    
    - Point Update: O(logN)
        
    - Prefix Sum Query: O(logN)
        
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [307. Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)
    
- **Description:** The same problem as for Segment Trees, showcasing an alternative solution.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: list[int]):
        self.n = len(nums)
        self.bit = [0] * (self.n + 1)
        self.nums = nums
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            self._update_bit(i + 1, num)

    def _update_bit(self, i: int, delta: int):
        while i <= self.n:
            self.bit[i] += delta
            i += i & (-i)

    def _query_bit(self, i: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while i > 0:
            res += self.bit[i]
            i -= i & (-i)
        return res

    def update(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        delta = val - self.nums[index]
        self.nums[index] = val
        self._update_bit(index + 1, delta)

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self._query_bit(right + 1) - self._query_bit(left)
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/)**: A classic BIT problem. After coordinating the numbers to a positive range, you iterate through the input array from right to left. For each number `x`, you query the BIT for how many numbers smaller than `x` have been seen so far, and then you update the BIT at position `x`.
    
2. **[493. Reverse Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-pairs/)**: Similar to the above, this problem can be solved with a BIT (or Merge Sort). You need to count pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`. You can iterate through the numbers and use the BIT to query how many numbers greater than `2 * num` have been seen.

## 34. Trie (Prefix Tree)

A Trie is a special tree-like data structure used to store and retrieve strings efficiently. It excels at tasks involving prefixes, such as autocomplete or dictionary searches. Unlike a binary tree, a node in a Trie can have multiple children (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters), and nodes themselves don't store values; the path from the root to a node represents a key or prefix.

### The Core Idea

1. **Structure:** The root represents an empty string. Each node has an array of children pointers (e.g., size 26) and a boolean flag, `isEndOfWord`.
    
2. **Insertion:** To insert a word, you traverse from the root, character by character. If a path for a character doesn't exist, you create a new node. When you reach the end of the word, you mark the final node's `isEndOfWord` flag as `True`.
    
3. **Search:** To search for a word, you traverse from the root. If at any point the path for a character doesn't exist, the word isn't in the Trie. If you reach the end of the word, you check the `isEndOfWord` flag to see if it's a complete word or just a prefix.
    

### Visual Diagram

**Inserting "car", "cat", "can":**

```
          (root)
           /
         (c)
         /
       (a)
      / | \
    (r) (t) (n)
    (*) (*) (*)   <-- (*) indicates isEndOfWord = True
```

### Complexities

Let `L` be the length of the longest word and `N` be the number of words.

- **Time Complexity:**
    
    - Insertion: O(L)
        
    - Search: O(L)
        
    - Starts With (Prefix Search): O(L)
        
- **Space Complexity:** O(NtimesL) in the worst case (no overlapping prefixes).
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)
    
- **Description:** Implement the Trie data structure with `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` methods.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # A dictionary for children nodes
        self.isEndOfWord = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        curr = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in curr.children:
                curr.children[char] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[char]
        curr.isEndOfWord = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[char]
        return curr.isEndOfWord

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[char]
        return True
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/)**: The search function must handle a `.` wildcard, which can match any character. This requires modifying the search to be a recursive DFS. When a `.` is encountered, you must recursively search down all existing children of the current node.
    
2. **[212. Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)**: A brilliant combination of Trie and Backtracking/DFS. First, you insert all words from the dictionary into a Trie. Then, you perform a single DFS from every cell of the board. As you move from cell to cell, you also move down the Trie. This prunes the search space dramatically, as you only explore paths that correspond to valid prefixes in your dictionary.
    
3. **[648. Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)**: You are given a dictionary of "roots" and a sentence. You need to replace each "successor" word in the sentence with the shortest root it starts with. A Trie is perfect for this. Insert all roots into the Trie. Then, for each word in the sentence, traverse the Trie character by character to find the shortest prefix that is a valid root.
