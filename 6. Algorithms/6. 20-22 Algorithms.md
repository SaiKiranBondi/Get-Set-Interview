## 20. Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

This is a data structure that is incredibly efficient at managing a collection of items partitioned into non-overlapping (disjoint) sets. It's the perfect tool for problems involving connected components, like checking if two nodes are in the same network or finding cycles in a graph.

It has two primary operations:

- **`find(i)`:** Determines which set an element `i` belongs to by finding the "representative" or "root" of that set.
- **`union(i, j)`:** Merges the two sets containing elements `i` and `j`.

### The Core Idea & Optimizations

Imagine each set as a tree, where the root is the representative.

- **`find(i)`:** To find the set for `i`, you just travel up the tree from `i` until you reach the root.
- **`union(i, j)`:** You find the roots of `i` and `j`. If they are different, you make one root the child of the other, merging the two trees.
- **Optimization 1: Path Compression:** During a `find` operation, after finding the root, you re-attach all nodes along the path directly to the root. This flattens the tree, making future `find` operations much faster.
- **Optimization 2: Union by Size/Rank:** When merging, always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. This keeps the trees from becoming too tall and unbalanced.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Let's union elements (0, 1), (2, 3), then (0, 2).

Initial: [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] (Each element is its own parent)

1. **`union(0, 1)`:** `parent[1] = 0`. Set `0` becomes the parent of `1`.
    
    ```
      (0)
      /
    (1)
    ```
    
2. **`union(2, 3)`:** `parent[3] = 2`. Set `2` becomes the parent of `3`.
    
    ```
      (0)   (2)
      /     /
    (1)   (3)
    ```
    
3. **`union(0, 2)`:** Find root of `0` (it's `0`). Find root of `2` (it's `2`). Make `2` a child of `0`.
    
    ```
        (0)
        / \
      (1) (2)
          /
        (3)
    ```
    

Now `find(3)` would traverse `3 -> 2 -> 0`. With path compression, it would then attach `3` directly to `0`.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** Nearly constant time on average for `find` and `union`, specifically O(alpha(N)), where alpha(N) is the Inverse Ackermann function. For all practical purposes, this can be considered O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the parent/size arrays.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)
- **Description:** Given an adjacency matrix representing cities, find the total number of connected groups of cities (provinces).

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.num_provinces = n

    def find(self, i):
        if self.parent[i] == i:
            return i
        # Path compression
        self.parent[i] = self.find(self.parent[i])
        return self.parent[i]

    def union(self, i, j):
        root_i = self.find(i)
        root_j = self.find(j)
        if root_i != root_j:
            self.parent[root_j] = root_i
            self.num_provinces -= 1

def findCircleNum(isConnected: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(isConnected)
    dsu = DSU(n)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if isConnected[i][j] == 1:
                dsu.union(i, j)
                
    return dsu.num_provinces
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)**
    
    - **Variation:** An undirected graph is formed by adding edges one by one. Find the first edge that creates a cycle.
    - **Logic Change:** Process edges one by one. For an edge `(u, v)`, if `find(u)` is already the same as `find(v)`, it means `u` and `v` are already connected. Adding this edge creates a cycle, so it's the redundant one. Otherwise, perform a `union(u, v)`.
        
2. **[990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Given equations like `"a==b"` and `"b!=c"`, determine if they can all be true.
    - **Logic Change:** Use DSU to group variables.
    - **Brief Explanation:** First, process all `==` equations. For each `"a==b"`, perform a `union(a, b)`. After this, process all `!=` equations. For each `"a!=b"`, if `find(a)` is the same as `find(b)`, it's a contradiction, so return `False`. If you get through all checks, return `True`.

Let's break down the **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** data structure with a clearer analogy, a detailed trace, and a practical use case.

### The Analogy: Friend Circles

Imagine you're organizing a large party. Initially, no one knows each other, so every person is their own "friend circle" of one.

- **The Data:** Each person is an element.
- **The Goal:** You want to efficiently track which friend circle each person belongs to as people get introduced.

The DSU structure helps you answer two questions very quickly:

1. **`find(person)`:** "Which friend circle is this person in?" To do this, we just need to identify the "representative" of the circle (think of them as the most popular person or the one who started the circle).
2. **`union(person_A, person_B)`:** "These two people just became friends." This means their entire friend circles now merge into one larger circle.

### Core Components

To manage this, we use two simple arrays:

1. `parent`: An array where `parent[i]` stores the parent of person `i`. If `parent[i] == i`, then `i` is the representative (the root) of their friend circle.
2. `size`: An array where `size[i]` stores the number of people in the circle if `i` is the representative. This is used for an important optimization.

### A Detailed Use Case & Trace

**Use Case:** You are a network administrator with 6 computers, numbered 0 to 5. You are given a list of direct connections. Your task is to determine if computer `1` can communicate with computer `5`.

**Connections (Edges):** `(0, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`

#### Step 1: Initialization

We start by creating our `parent` and `size` arrays. Initially, every computer is its own representative, forming a network of one.

parent = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Every element is its own parent)

size = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (Every circle has a size of 1)

Visual:

[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

---
#### Step 2: Processing Connections (The `union` operation)

We process the connections one by one.

**Connection 1: `union(0, 1)`**

1. **Find representatives:**
    - `find(0)` traverses up from 0. The parent of 0 is 0. So, the root is **0**.
    - `find(1)` traverses up from 1. The parent of 1 is 1. So, the root is **1**.
2. **Check sizes:** `size[0]` is 1, and `size[1]` is 1. They are equal. Let's decide to make `0` the new representative.
3. **Merge:** We point the parent of `1`'s root (which is 1) to `0`'s root (which is 0). So, `parent[1] = 0`.
4. **Update size:** The new size of circle `0` is `size[0] + size[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.

State after union(0, 1):

parent = [0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
size = [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Visual:**

```
  (0)      [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]`
  /
(1)
```

_(Computers 0 and 1 are now in the same network)_

---

**Connection 2: `union(1, 2)`**

1. **Find representatives (with Path Compression):**
    - `find(1)`: It starts at 1. `parent[1]` is 0. It goes to 0. `parent[0]` is 0. The root is **0**.
    - `find(2)`: The parent of 2 is 2. The root is **2**.
2. **Check sizes:** `size[0]` is 2, and `size[2]` is 1. The circle represented by `0` is larger.
3. **Merge (Union by Size):** We make the smaller circle join the larger one. We point the parent of `2`'s root (which is 2) to `0`'s root (which is 0). So, `parent[2] = 0`.
4. **Update size:** The new size of circle `0` is `size[0] + size[2] = 2 + 1 = 3`.

State after union(1, 2):

parent = [0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5]

size = [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

**Visual:**

```
    (0)        [3]  [4]  [5]`
   /  \
 (1)  (2)
```

_(Computers 0, 1, and 2 are now in the same network)_

---

**Connection 3: `union(3, 4)`**

1. **Find representatives:** `find(3)` is **3**. `find(4)` is **4**.
2. **Check sizes:** `size[3]` is 1, `size[4]` is 1. They are equal. Let's make `3` the representative.
3. **Merge:** `parent[4] = 3`.
4. **Update size:** `size[3]` becomes 2.

State after union(3, 4):

parent = [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 5]

size = [3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]

**Visual:**

```
    (0)        (3)      [5]`
   /  \        /
 (1)  (2)    (4)
```

_(We now have three distinct networks: `{0,1,2}`, `{3,4}`, and `{5}`)_

---

#### Step 3: Answering the Question

Now, we answer the original question: **"Can computer `1` communicate with computer `5`?"**

To do this, we just check if they are in the same set.

1. `find(1)`:
    
    - Start at 1. `parent[1]` is 0.
    - Go to 0. `parent[0]` is 0. The root is **0**.
    - **Path Compression:** While returning, we set `parent[1] = 0` (it already was, but this is where it would happen).
    
2. `find(5)`:
    
    - Start at 5. `parent[5]` is 5. The root is **5**.
    
3. **Compare Representatives:** Is `find(1) == find(5)`? Is `0 == 5`? **No.**

**Conclusion:** Computer `1` and computer `5` are in different networks and cannot communicate.

This entire process is incredibly fast. Even with millions of computers and connections, finding if two are connected takes nearly constant time, which is why DSU is such a powerful tool for connectivity problems.

## 21. KMP Algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt)

KMP is a highly efficient string searching algorithm. Its key innovation is that it intelligently uses information from mismatches. When a mismatch occurs, it doesn't just shift the pattern by one; it uses a pre-computed "Longest Proper Prefix which is also a Suffix" (LPS) array to make the largest possible shift, avoiding re-checking characters that are already known to match.

### The Core Idea

1. **Pre-computation (LPS Array):** For the `pattern` you're searching for, create an LPS array. `lps[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...i]` which is also a suffix of `pattern[0...i]`.
2. **Searching:** Match the `text` and `pattern`. If a mismatch occurs at `text[i]` and `pattern[j]`, you don't go back. You consult `lps[j-1]` to find the new position for the pattern pointer, effectively sliding the pattern forward without re-comparing known matched prefixes.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**Pattern:** `"aabaac"` -> **LPS Array:** `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0]`

- `lps[4] = 2` because for `"aabaa"`, the prefix `"aa"` is also a suffix.

**Search Trace:** `text = "aabaacaabaac"`, `pattern = "aabaac"`

```
text:    a a b a a c a a b a a c
pattern: a a b a a c
                  ^ Mismatch! (text='a', pattern='c')
```

- Naive search would shift pattern by 1.
    
- **KMP:** The mismatch happened at pattern index `j=5`. We consult `lps[j-1] = lps[4] = 2`. This tells us the pattern has a prefix of length 2 (`"aa"`) that matches the suffix of the part that just matched (`...aa`c). We can slide the pattern forward so this prefix aligns with that suffix. The new `j` becomes `lps[j-1]`, which is 2.

```
text:    a a b a a c a a b a a c
pattern:           a a b a a c
                   ^ Continue search from here
```

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N+M) where N is text length, M is pattern length.
- **Space Complexity:** O(M) for the LPS array.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)
- **Description:** The exact problem KMP was designed to solve.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    if not needle: return 0
    m, n = len(haystack), len(needle)
    
    # Build LPS array
    lps = [0] * n
    prevLPS, i = 0, 1
    while i < n:
        if needle[i] == needle[prevLPS]:
            lps[i] = prevLPS + 1
            prevLPS += 1
            i += 1
        elif prevLPS == 0:
            lps[i] = 0
            i += 1
        else:
            prevLPS = lps[prevLPS - 1]

    # KMP Search
    i = 0  # pointer for haystack
    j = 0  # pointer for needle
    while i < m:
        if haystack[i] == needle[j]:
            i, j = i + 1, j + 1
        else:
            if j == 0:
                i += 1
            else:
                j = lps[j - 1]
        if j == n:
            return i - n
            
    return -1
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[214. Shortest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Add characters to the front of a string to make it a palindrome.
    - **Logic Change:** The LPS array is the key.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Construct a new string `s + '#' + reversed(s)`. The LPS value of the _last character_ of this new string tells you the length of the longest palindromic prefix of the original string `s`. The characters you need to add are the reverse of the part of `s` that is _not_ in this palindromic prefix.
        
2. **[1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-prefix/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the longest non-empty prefix that is also a suffix.
    - **Logic Change:** This is a direct application of the LPS array.
    - **Brief Explanation:** The problem is literally asking you to build the LPS array for the given string and return the prefix whose length is given by the last value in that LPS array.

## 22. Rabin-Karp Algorithm

Rabin-Karp is another string searching algorithm that uses a clever trick: **hashing**. It avoids a lot of character-by-character comparisons by comparing the hash values of the pattern and the current "window" of the text.

### The Core Idea

1. **Hashing:** Calculate a hash value for the `pattern`.
2. **Rolling Hash:** Calculate a hash value for the first window of the `text` (same length as the pattern). Then, "slide" the window one character at a time. Instead of re-hashing the whole new window, you can efficiently update the hash in O(1) time by mathematically "removing" the old character and "adding" the new one.
3. **Comparison:** If the hash of the pattern matches the hash of the current window, it's a _potential_ match. Only then do you perform a full character-by-character comparison to confirm (this avoids false positives from hash collisions).

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Rolling Hash)

Text: "abcde", Window Size: 3
Hash("abc") = (a*p^2 + b*p^1 + c*p^0) % mod
To get Hash("bcd") from Hash("abc"):

1. Subtract `a`'s contribution: `hash_abc - a*p^2`
2. Shift left: `(result_from_1) * p`
3. Add d's contribution: (result_from_2) + d

    This is much faster than re-calculating b*p^2 + c*p^1 + d*p^0.


### Complexities

- **Average Time:** O(N+M). This is the common case where hash collisions are rare.
- **Worst Time:** O(NtimesM). This happens if every window has the same hash as the pattern (a pathological case), forcing a character comparison at every step.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)
- **Description:** An alternative to KMP for the same problem.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(haystack), len(needle)
    if n > m: return -1

    BASE = 26
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Pre-calculate power for removing the first character
    power_n = pow(BASE, n - 1, MOD)

    # Calculate hash of needle and first window of haystack
    hash_needle = 0
    hash_haystack = 0
    for i in range(n):
        hash_needle = (hash_needle * BASE + ord(needle[i])) % MOD
        hash_haystack = (hash_haystack * BASE + ord(haystack[i])) % MOD
    
    # Slide the window
    for i in range(m - n + 1):
        if hash_haystack == hash_needle:
            # Hashes match, confirm with string comparison
            if haystack[i : i + n] == needle:
                return i
        
        # Calculate rolling hash for the next window
        if i + n < m:
            # Remove leading character
            hash_haystack = (hash_haystack - ord(haystack[i]) * power_n) % MOD
            # Shift left
            hash_haystack = (hash_haystack * BASE) % MOD
            # Add trailing character
            hash_haystack = (hash_haystack + ord(haystack[i + n])) % MOD
            
    return -1
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[1044. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the longest substring that appears at least twice.
    - **Logic Change:** This is a perfect use case for combining Rabin-Karp with "Binary Search on Answer".
    - **Brief Explanation:** You binary search for the _length_ `L` of the duplicate substring. The `check(L)` function uses a rolling hash to find if any substring of length `L` has a hash value that has been seen before. If yes, `L` is a possible answer, and you try for a longer one. If no, you must try a shorter `L`.
    
2. **[187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find all 10-letter-long sequences that occur more than once.
    - **Logic Change:** A direct application of a rolling hash over a fixed-size window.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Slide a window of size 10 over the DNA string. Calculate the rolling hash for each window. Use two hash sets: one to store the hashes of windows seen once (`seen`), and another to store the actual substrings for windows seen more than once (`duplicates`). If a hash is in `seen`, add the corresponding substring to `duplicates`. Otherwise, add the hash to `seen`.
