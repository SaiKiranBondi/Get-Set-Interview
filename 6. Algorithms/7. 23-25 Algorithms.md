## 23. DFS and BFS (Graph Traversals)

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are the two most fundamental algorithms for traversing or searching a graph. They provide a systematic way to visit every node and edge. The only difference between them is the order in which they explore nodes.

### The Core Ideas

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible down one branch before backtracking. It uses a **Stack** (or recursion, which uses the call stack).
    - **Analogy:** Solving a maze by taking the first path you see, and when you hit a dead end, you backtrack to the last junction and try the next available path.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a **Queue**.    
    - **Analogy:** The ripples created when you drop a stone in a pond. The wave expands outwards, level by level, visiting all points at the same distance before moving further out.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Let's trace the traversal of this graph starting from node **A**:

```
      A
     / \
    B---C
    |   |
    D---E
```

|Traversal|Order of Visit|Data Structure|Path Taken|
|---|---|---|---|
|**DFS**|A, B, D, E, C|Stack|Starts at A, goes deep to B, then D, then E. From E, it sees C is a neighbor. Visits C. Backtracks. All done.|
|**BFS**|A, B, C, D, E|Queue|Starts at A. Visits its neighbors B and C. Then visits B's unvisited neighbor D. Then C's unvisited neighbor E.|

### Complexities

For a graph with V vertices and E edges:

- **Time Complexity:** O(V+E) because you visit every vertex and every edge exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:**
    
    - DFS: O(H) where H is the maximum height/depth of the graph (for the recursion stack). In the worst case (a long chain), this is O(V).
    - BFS: O(W) where W is the maximum width of the graph (for the queue). In the worst case (a star graph), this is O(V).
    
### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution (BFS)

- **Problem:** [1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-path-exists-in-graph/)
- **Description:** Given edges of a graph, determine if a path exists between a `source` and a `destination` node.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
from collections import deque

def validPath(n: int, edges: list[list[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
    # 1. Build the adjacency list representation of the graph.
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        adj_list[v].append(u)

    # 2. Perform BFS to find the path.
    queue = deque([source])
    visited = {source}

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if node == destination:
            return True
            
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
                
    return False
```

`popleft` -> BFS (Works as FIFO)
`pop` -> DFS (Works as Stack)
### LeetCode Variants

1. **[133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Create a deep copy of a graph.
    - **Logic Change:** You need to traverse the original graph while building the new one. A hash map is essential to store the mapping from `original_node -> cloned_node` to avoid getting stuck in cycles.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Start a traversal (DFS or BFS) from the source node. As you visit each original node, if you haven't seen it before, create its clone and store it in the map. Then, for the current original node, iterate through its neighbors. For each neighbor, find its clone in the map (or create it if it doesn't exist) and add it to the cloned neighbors list of the current cloned node.
        
2. **[127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord`, changing one letter at a time.
    - **Logic Change:** This is a shortest path problem on an unweighted graph, which is a perfect use case for BFS. The "nodes" are the words, and an "edge" exists between two words if they are one letter apart.
    - **Brief Explanation:** You don't build the graph explicitly. Start a BFS with `(beginWord, 1)`. In each step, pop a word, and generate all its possible one-letter-different neighbors. If a neighbor is the `endWord`, return its level. If it's a valid word in the word list, add it to the queue and remove it from the word list to avoid cycles.

## 24. Topological Sort

Topological Sort is a linear ordering of nodes in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. For every directed edge from node `u` to node `v`, `u` must come before `v` in the ordering. If the graph has a cycle, a topological sort is not possible.

### The Core Idea

The most intuitive method is **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based)**:

1. **Compute In-degrees:** For every node, count how many incoming edges it has.
2. **Initialize Queue:** Find all nodes with an in-degree of 0 and add them to a queue. These are the nodes with no prerequisites.
3. **Process:**
    
    - Take a node from the queue and add it to your sorted list.
    - For each of its neighbors, "remove the prerequisite" by decrementing their in-degree by 1.
    - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
    
4. **Check for Cycles:** If the final sorted list doesn't contain all the nodes, the graph must have had a cycle.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Problem: Find the order to take these courses.

101 -> 201, 101 -> 202, 201 -> 301, 202 -> 301

1. **In-degrees:** `101: 0`, `201: 1`, `202: 1`, `301: 2`
2. **Queue:** `[101]`
3. **Process `101`:**
    
    - `sorted_list = [101]`
    - Neighbor `201`: in-degree becomes 0. Add to queue.
    - Neighbor `202`: in-degree becomes 0. Add to queue.
    - Queue: `[201, 202]`
    
4. **Process `201`:**
    
    - `sorted_list = [101, 201]`
    - Neighbor `301`: in-degree becomes 1.
    - Queue: `[202]`
    
5. **Process `202`:**
    
    - `sorted_list = [101, 201, 202]`
    - Neighbor `301`: in-degree becomes 0. Add to queue.
    - Queue: `[301]`
    
6. **Process `301`:**
    
    - `sorted_list = [101, 201, 202, 301]`
    - Queue is empty. Done.

**Final Order:** `[101, 201, 202, 301]` (Note: `201` and `202` could be swapped).

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(V+E) to build the graph and visit each node/edge once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V+E) for the adjacency list, in-degree array, and queue.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
- **Description:** Given prerequisites, determine if you can finish all courses. (This is asking if the graph has a cycle).

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
from collections import deque

def canFinish(numCourses: int, prerequisites: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
    # Build adjacency list and in-degree array
    adj = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
    in_degree = [0] * numCourses
    for course, prereq in prerequisites:
        adj[prereq].append(course)
        in_degree[course] += 1

    # Initialize queue with courses that have no prerequisites
    queue = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if in_degree[i] == 0])
    
    courses_taken = 0
    while queue:
        prereq = queue.popleft()
        courses_taken += 1
        
        for course in adj[prereq]:
            in_degree[course] -= 1
            if in_degree[course] == 0:
                queue.append(course)
                
    # If we took all courses, it was possible.
    return courses_taken == numCourses
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Instead of returning `true/false`, return the actual topological order.
    - **Logic Change:** The exact same algorithm applies. You just need to store the nodes as they are popped from the queue.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Maintain a `sorted_order` list. When a node is popped from the queue, append it to this list. At the end, if the length of the list equals the number of courses, return the list; otherwise, return an empty list.
    
2. **[269. Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)**
    
    - **Variation:** A list of words sorted in an alien language's dictionary order is given. Find the order of letters.
    - **Logic Change:** The main challenge is building the graph from the words.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Compare adjacent words in the list. The first character where they differ gives you a prerequisite rule (e.g., if `"wrt"` comes before `"wrf"`, then `t` must come before `f`). Collect all such rules to build a directed graph. Then, perform a topological sort on the graph of letters to find the alien alphabet order.

## 25. Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a **weighted graph with non-negative edge weights**. It's a greedy algorithm that always explores the next "closest" unvisited node.

### The Core Idea

1. **Initialization:**
    
    - Create a `distances` array, initializing the `source` node's distance to `0` and all others to infinity.
    - Create a **min-priority queue** (min-heap) and push the tuple `(distance, node)` for the source, i.e., `(0, source)`.
    
2. **Process Queue:**
    
    - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the node with the smallest distance. Let this be `(dist, u)`.
    - If `dist` is greater than the already known distance to `u`, skip it (this is an outdated entry).
    - For each neighbor `v` of `u`:
        
        - Calculate the new potential distance to `v`: `new_dist = dist + weight(u, v)`.
        - If `new_dist` is shorter than the current recorded distance to `v`, update `distances[v] = new_dist` and push `(new_dist, v)` to the priority queue.
        
### Visual Diagram & Trace

**Goal:** Find shortest paths from **A**.

```
      (4)
    A-----B
    | \   | (2)
 (1)|  \  |
    | (8)\ |
    C-----D
      (7)
```

dist array: [A:0, B:inf, C:inf, D:inf]

Priority Queue (PQ): [(0, A)]

1. **Pop `(0, A)`:**
    
    - Neighbor B: `dist=4`. Update `dist[B]=4`. Push `(4, B)`.
    - Neighbor C: `dist=1`. Update `dist[C]=1`. Push `(1, C)`.
    - PQ: `[(1, C), (4, B)]`
    
2. **Pop `(1, C)`:**
    
    - Neighbor D: `dist=1+7=8`. Update `dist[D]=8`. Push `(8, D)`.
    - PQ: `[(4, B), (8, D)]`
    
3. **Pop `(4, B)`:**
    
    - Neighbor D: `dist=4+2=6`. `6 < 8`. Update `dist[D]=6`. Push `(6, D)`.
    - PQ: `[(6, D), (8, D)]`
    
4. **Pop `(6, D)`:** No unvisited neighbors to update.
    
5. **Pop `(8, D)`:** The recorded `dist[D]` is `6`, which is less than `8`. Skip.
    
6. PQ is empty. Done.

**Final Distances from A:** `{A:0, B:4, C:1, D:6}`

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(ElogV) where E is edges, V is vertices. The `log V` comes from the push/pop operations of the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V+E) for the adjacency list, distances array, and priority queue.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/)
- **Description:** You are given a network of nodes, a source node `k`, and travel times between nodes. Find how long it will take for a signal to reach all nodes.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
import heapq

def networkDelayTime(times: list[list[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
    # Build adjacency list: {node -> list of (neighbor, weight)}
    adj = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u, v, w in times:
        adj[u].append((v, w))

    # Min-heap (priority queue) and distances dictionary
    pq = [(0, k)] # (distance, node)
    distances = {}

    while pq:
        dist, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # If we've already found a shorter path to this node, skip.
        if node in distances:
            continue
        
        distances[node] = dist
        
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                new_dist = dist + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor))
    
    # If we didn't visit all nodes, it's impossible.
    if len(distances) != n:
        return -1
    
    # The answer is the time it takes to reach the furthest node.
    return max(distances.values())
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the path with the maximum _product_ of probabilities, not the minimum sum.
    - **Logic Change:** Use a **max-heap** instead of a min-heap. The "distance" update logic becomes multiplication (`new_prob = prob * weight`).
    - **Brief Explanation:** To use Python's `heapq` (a min-heap) as a max-heap, store negative probabilities. The core Dijkstra's structure remains the same, but you're maximizing a product instead of minimizing a sum.
    
2. **[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the cheapest path with at most `K` stops.
    - **Logic Change:** Standard Dijkstra doesn't work because a path that seems "longer" now might become the optimal one later if it uses fewer stops.
    - **Brief Explanation:** You need to modify Dijkstra's. The state in the priority queue must be `(cost, node, stops)`. When you explore neighbors, you only push them to the queue if `stops < K`. You also can't use a simple `visited` set, because you might need to revisit a node via a different path with fewer stops. A `distances` array that tracks `dist[stops][node]` is a common approach. This problem is also a classic for the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
