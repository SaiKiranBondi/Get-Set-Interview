## 8. Two Pointers Technique 👉👈

This is a **pattern**, not a single algorithm. It's an extremely common and efficient technique for problems involving **sorted arrays** or lists where you need to find a pair or a set of elements that satisfy a certain condition. It avoids slower nested loops by intelligently traversing the data.

### The Core Idea

You initialize two pointers, typically one at the very beginning (`left`) and one at the very end (`right`) of a sorted array. You then move them towards each other based on the sum or property of the elements they point to, converging on the solution in a single pass.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**Problem:** In the sorted array `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, find two numbers that add up to `target = 9`.

1. **Initial State:**
    
    ```
    [ 2,  7,  11,  15 ]
      ^           ^
      L           R
    ```

    - `nums[L] + nums[R]` = `2 + 15` = `17`.
    - `17 > 9` (Sum is too big). To make the sum smaller, we must move the right pointer left.
    - `R--`.

2. **Step 2:**
    
    ```
    [ 2,  7,  11,  15 ]
      ^       ^
      L       R
    ```
    
    - `nums[L] + nums[R]` = `2 + 11` = `13`.
    - `13 > 9` (Still too big). Move the right pointer left again.
    - `R--`.

3. **Step 3:**
    
    ```
    [ 2,  7,  11,  15 ]
      ^   ^
      L   R
    ```
    
    - `nums[L] + nums[R]` = `2 + 7` = `9`.
    - `9 == 9`. **Match found!** Return the indices.


### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) (Best, Average, and Worst). The pointers together make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). It only uses a few variables for the pointers.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
- **Description:** Given a 1-indexed sorted array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def twoSum(numbers: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Finds two numbers in a sorted array that add up to the target.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1

    while left < right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

        if current_sum == target:
            # LeetCode asks for 1-based indexing, so we add 1.
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum < target:
            # Sum is too small, need a larger value. Move left pointer right.
            left += 1
        else: # current_sum > target
            # Sum is too big, need a smaller value. Move right pointer left.
            right -= 1
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find all unique triplets `(a, b, c)` that sum to zero.
    - **Logic Change:** First, sort the array. Then, loop through the array with a pointer `i`. For each `nums[i]`, run the Two Pointers technique on the rest of the array to find two numbers that sum to `-nums[i]`.
    - **Brief Explanation:** The problem `a + b + c = 0` becomes `b + c = -a`. The outer loop fixes `a`, and the two pointers find `b` and `c`. You must add logic to skip duplicate values to ensure unique triplets.

2. **[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container that holds the most water.
    - **Logic Change:** The area is `width * min(height[L], height[R])`. The width is always decreasing as pointers move inward. To have a chance at a larger area, you must try to increase the minimum height.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Start pointers at both ends. Calculate the area. To potentially find a larger area, you must discard the shorter of the two lines. So, if `height[L] < height[R]`, you move `L` right. Otherwise, you move `R` left.

## 9. Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)

This is a clever and powerful pattern used almost exclusively with linked lists. It involves using two pointers that traverse the list at different speeds. This difference in speed allows you to solve a variety of problems, most notably cycle detection and finding the middle of a list.

- **Slow Pointer:** Moves one step at a time (`slow = slow.next`).
- **Fast Pointer:** Moves two steps at a time (`fast = fast.next.next`).

### The Core Idea

The key insight is how the pointers interact based on the list's structure:

- **If the list has no cycle:** The fast pointer will always be ahead of the slow pointer and will eventually reach the end of the list (`null`) first.
    
- **If the list has a cycle:** The fast pointer will enter the cycle first and start looping. The slow pointer will eventually enter the cycle as well. Since the fast pointer is moving faster, it will inevitably "lap" the slow pointer, and they will meet at some node inside the cycle. If they meet, a cycle is confirmed.
    

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Cycle Detection)

**List:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3` (node 5 points back to node 3)

|Step|Slow Pointer Position|Fast Pointer Position|Met?|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|2|3|No|
|2|3|5|No|
|3|4|4 (`3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4`)|No|
|4|5|3 (`4 -> 5 -> 3`)|No|
|5|3|5 (`3 -> 4 -> 5`)|No|
|6|4|4 (`5 -> 3 -> 4`)|**Yes!**|

Since the pointers met, we have detected a cycle.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) because in the worst case, both pointers traverse the entire list.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we only use two pointers.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
    
- **Description:** Given the head of a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

def hasCycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return False
        
    slow = head
    fast = head.next # Start fast one step ahead

    while slow != fast:
        # If fast pointer reaches the end, there's no cycle.
        if not fast or not fast.next:
            return False
            
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
    # If the loop terminates, it's because slow == fast.
    return True
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the middle node of a linked list.
        
    - **Logic Change:** Use the same two pointers. When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be exactly at the middle.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Since the slow pointer moves at half the speed of the fast one, by the time the fast pointer has traversed `2N` nodes (the whole list), the slow pointer will have traversed `N` nodes (half the list).
        
2. **[142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)**
    
    - **Variation:** If a cycle exists, return the node where the cycle begins.
        
    - **Logic Change:** This requires a second phase after the pointers meet.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** After `slow` and `fast` meet inside the cycle, reset one pointer (e.g., `slow`) back to the `head` of the list. Now, move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time. The node where they meet again is the starting node of the cycle. This is a mathematical property of the algorithm.

## 10. Reverse a Linked List

This is arguably the most essential "building block" operation for linked list problems. Many complex linked list problems break down into sub-problems that require reversing a portion of the list. The iterative approach is the most common and efficient.

### The Core Idea (Iterative)

You need to walk through the list and, for each node, reverse the direction of its `.next` pointer. To do this without losing the rest of the list, you need three pointers:

- **`prev`:** Points to the node that came _before_ the current one. Starts as `None`.
    
- **`curr`:** The current node you are processing. Starts as `head`.
    
- **`next_node`:** A temporary pointer to save the _next_ node before you break the link.
    

The process for each node is: Save `curr.next`, point `curr.next` to `prev`, then move `prev` and `curr` one step forward.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**List:** `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None`

Initial State:

prev = None

curr = 1

**Iteration 1 (Processing Node 1):**

1. `next_node = curr.next` (saves node 2)
    
2. `curr.next = prev` (node 1 now points to `None`)
    
3. `prev = curr` (`prev` is now node 1)
    
4. curr = next_node (curr is now node 2)
    
    State: None <- 1 2 -> 3 -> None
    
    ^ ^
    
    prev curr
    

**Iteration 2 (Processing Node 2):**

1. `next_node = curr.next` (saves node 3)
    
2. `curr.next = prev` (node 2 now points to node 1)
    
3. `prev = curr` (`prev` is now node 2)
    
4. curr = next_node (curr is now node 3)
    
    State: None <- 1 <- 2 3 -> None
    
    ^ ^
    
    prev curr
    

**Iteration 3 (Processing Node 3):**

1. `next_node = curr.next` (saves `None`)
    
2. `curr.next = prev` (node 3 now points to node 2)
    
3. `prev = curr` (`prev` is now node 3)
    
4. curr = next_node (curr is now None)
    
    State: None <- 1 <- 2 <- 3
    
    ^
    
    prev
    
    The loop terminates because curr is None. The new head of the reversed list is prev.
    

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) because you visit each node exactly once.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the iterative solution, as you only use a few pointers.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
    
- **Description:** Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the new head.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

def reverseList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    prev = None
    curr = head

    while curr:
        # Store the next node before we overwrite curr.next
        next_node = curr.next
        
        # Reverse the pointer
        curr.next = prev
        
        # Move pointers one step forward for the next iteration
        prev = curr
        curr = next_node
        
    # At the end, `prev` will be the new head of the reversed list
    return prev
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[234. Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Check if a linked list is a palindrome.
        
    - **Logic Change:** You can't go backward in a singly linked list. The trick is to reverse half of it.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Use the fast/slow pointer technique to find the middle of the list. Reverse the second half of the list. Now, use two pointers—one at the original head and one at the head of the reversed second half—and compare them node by node.
        
2. **[92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Reverse only a specific portion of the list, from position `left` to `right`.
        
    - **Logic Change:** You need to carefully manage the connections at the boundaries of the reversed section.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** First, traverse to the node just before the `left` position. Then, apply the standard reversal logic for the specified number of nodes. Finally, connect the `left-1` node to the new head of the reversed section, and connect the tail of the reversed section to the `right+1` node.
        
3. **[25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Reverse the linked list in chunks of size `k`.
        
    - **Logic Change:** Apply the reversal logic repeatedly to segments of the list.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** This is a much harder version of reversing. You iterate through the list, and for each group of `k` nodes, you reverse it. The main complexity is "stitching" the end of the previously reversed group to the head of the newly reversed group.

---
## 11. Sliding Window Technique 🖼️

This is another essential **pattern** for problems on arrays or strings. It involves maintaining a "window" (a sub-array or sub-string) and "sliding" it over the data. The window, defined by `start` and `end` pointers, can be of a fixed size or a dynamic size that grows and shrinks to satisfy a condition.

### The Core Idea

You expand the window by moving the `end` pointer to the right. When the window's state no longer meets the problem's criteria (e.g., it contains a duplicate character, or its sum exceeds a target), you shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer to the right until the condition is met again.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**Problem:** Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in `s = "pwwkew"`.

1. **`end=0` (`'p'`)**: Window `['p']`. No repeats. Length = 1. `max_len=1`.
2. **`end=1` (`'w'`)**: Window `['p', 'w']`. No repeats. Length = 2. `max_len=2`.
3. **`end=2` (`'w'`)**: Window `['p', 'w', 'w']`. **Repeat found!**
    - Shrink from left: Remove `'p'`. Window `['w', 'w']`. Still a repeat.
    - Shrink from left: Remove `'w'`. Window `['w']`. No repeats. Length = 1.
4. **`end=3` (`'k'`)**: Window `['w', 'k']`. No repeats. Length = 2. `max_len=2`.
5. **`end=4` (`'e'`)**: Window `['w', 'k', 'e']`. No repeats. Length = 3. `max_len=3`.
6. **`end=5` (`'w'`)**: Window `['w', 'k', 'e', 'w']`. **Repeat found!**
    - Shrink from left: Remove `'w'`. Window `['k', 'e', 'w']`. No repeats. Length = 3.

Final `max_len` is **3**.
### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N). Each pointer (`start` and `end`) traverses the array only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(K) where K is the number of unique elements in the window (e.g., size of the character set).

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
- **Description:** Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    """
    char_set = set() # A set to store characters in the current window
    left = 0         # The left pointer of the window
    max_length = 0

    # The right pointer of the window moves with the loop
    for right in range(len(s)):
        # If the character is already in our window, we must shrink the window
        # from the left until the duplicate is removed.
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        # Add the new character to our window's set (expanding the window)
        char_set.add(s[right])
        
        # Update the max length found so far
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        
    return max_length
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the length of the _smallest_ contiguous subarray whose sum is `>=` a target.
    - **Logic Change:** The window condition is based on the sum of its elements.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Expand the window by adding `nums[right]` to a `current_sum`. While `current_sum >= target`, record the window's length (and check if it's the new minimum), then shrink the window by subtracting `nums[left]` from the sum and moving `left` forward.
    
2. **[76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which contains all the characters of `t`.
    - **Logic Change:** Much more complex state tracking. You need two hash maps: one for the character counts required by `t`, and one for the character counts in your current window.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Expand the window until it contains all characters of `t` (checked by comparing the maps). Once you have a valid window, record its length and try to shrink it from the left as much as possible while keeping it valid.

## 12. Kadane's Algorithm

This is a brilliant and efficient dynamic programming approach to solve the "maximum subarray sum" problem. It answers the question: which contiguous part of this array has the largest possible sum?

### The Core Idea

The algorithm iterates through the array just once. At each step, it makes a simple decision for the element `x`:

1. Should I extend the "best subarray so far" by adding `x` to it?
2. Or is the previous subarray so bad (negative) that I'm better off starting a brand new subarray with just `x`?

It keeps track of the maximum sum ending at the current position (`current_max`) and the absolute maximum sum found anywhere in the array so far (`global_max`).

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Let's trace `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`

|Element|`current_max` Logic|`current_max` Value|`global_max` Value|
|---|---|---|---|
|**-2**|Start new: `max(-2, -2)`|-2|-2|
|**1**|Extend: `max(1, -2 + 1)`|1|1|
|**-3**|Extend: `max(-3, 1 + -3)`|-2|1|
|**4**|Start new: `max(4, -2 + 4)`|4|4|
|**-1**|Extend: `max(-1, 4 + -1)`|3|4|
|**2**|Extend: `max(2, 3 + 2)`|5|5|
|**1**|Extend: `max(1, 5 + 1)`|6|6|
|**-5**|Extend: `max(-5, 6 + -5)`|1|6|
|**4**|Extend: `max(4, 1 + 4)`|5|6|

The final answer is `global_max = 6`, which corresponds to the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) (Best, Average, and Worst) because it's a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because it only uses a few variables to store state.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
- **Description:** Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum and return its sum.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def maxSubArray(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    """
    Finds the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's Algorithm.
    """
    # Initialize both maxes with the first element of the array.
    # global_max stores the answer we will return.
    # current_max stores the max sum of a subarray ending at the current position.
    global_max = nums[0]
    current_max = nums[0]

    # Start iterating from the second element.
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        num = nums[i]
        # Decision: either extend the previous subarray or start a new one.
        current_max = max(num, current_max + num)
        
        # Update the global max if the current local max is greater.
        if current_max > global_max:
            global_max = current_max
            
    return global_max
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/)**
    
    - **Variation:** The array can "wrap around". The max subarray could be `[..., end] + [start, ...]`.
    - **Logic Change:** The answer is either (A) the normal max subarray (non-wrapping case) or (B) the total sum of the array minus the minimum subarray (wrapping case). The minimum subarray is found by inverting the array's signs and running Kadane's.
    - **Brief Explanation:** You find the standard `max_sum` with Kadane's. You also find the `min_sum` (by finding the max sum of the inverted array). The circular max is `total_sum - min_sum`. The final answer is `max(max_sum, total_sum - min_sum)`. (Edge case: if all numbers are negative, the answer is just the standard `max_sum`).
        
2. **[152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the maximum _product_ instead of sum.
        
    - **Logic Change:** A large negative number can become a large positive number if multiplied by another negative number.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** You must track both the `current_max_product` and `current_min_product` ending at the current position. The new max could be `current_num`, `current_num * old_max`, or `current_num * old_min`.
