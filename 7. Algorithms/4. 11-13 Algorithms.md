## 11. Prefix Sum

This is a powerful pre-computation technique that allows for incredibly fast calculation of the sum of any contiguous range (a subarray). It's all about trading some initial setup time and memory for the ability to answer range sum questions almost instantly.

### The Core Idea

You create a new array (the "prefix sum array") where each element `prefix[i]` stores the accumulated sum of all elements from the beginning of the original array up to index `i-1`. By convention, `prefix[0]` is often set to 0 to make calculations easier.

Once you have this, the sum of any range `[left...right]` in the original array can be found in constant time by calculating `prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left]`.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Original Array: `A = [2, 4, 1, 7, 3]`

1. **Build Prefix Sum Array `P` (with a leading 0):**
    
    - `P[0] = 0`
    - `P[1] = P[0] + A[0] = 0 + 2 = 2`
    - `P[2] = P[1] + A[1] = 2 + 4 = 6`
    - `P[3] = P[2] + A[2] = 6 + 1 = 7`
    - `P[4] = P[3] + A[3] = 7 + 7 = 14`
    - `P[5] = P[4] + A[4] = 14 + 3 = 17`
    - Result: `P = [0, 2, 6, 7, 14, 17]`
    
2. **Query:** Find the sum of subarray `A[1...3]` (which is `[4, 1, 7]`).
    
    - Formula: `P[right + 1] - P[left]` = `P[3 + 1] - P[1]` = `P[4] - P[1]`
    - Calculation: `14 - 2 = 12`. (Correct, as `4+1+7=12`).
    
### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) to build the array, then **O(1)** for every range sum query.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the prefix sum array.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [303. Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)
- **Description:** Given an integer array, handle multiple queries of calculating the sum of elements between indices `left` and `right` inclusive.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
class NumArray:
    def __init__(self, nums: list[int]):
        # The __init__ method is used for the pre-computation.
        # We make the prefix sum array 1 element longer to hold the initial 0.
        self.prefix_sum = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.prefix_sum[i + 1] = self.prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        # The query is now extremely fast and uses the formula directly.
        return self.prefix_sum[right + 1] - self.prefix_sum[left]
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Count how many subarrays sum to a target `k`.
    - **Logic Change:** The core idea is `sum(i, j) = k`, which translates to `prefix[j] - prefix[i-1] = k`. This rearranges to `prefix[i-1] = prefix[j] - k`.
    - **Brief Explanation:** You iterate through the array, calculating the running prefix sum. You use a hash map to store the frequencies of prefix sums encountered. For each `current_sum`, you check if `current_sum - k` exists in the map. If it does, it means you've found a valid subarray, so you add the frequency of `current_sum - k` to your total count.

2. **[1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)**
    
    - **Variation:** This uses the inverse concept, a **Difference Array**. You are given range updates (add `x` seats to all flights from `i` to `j`) and need to find the final state.
    - **Logic Change:** A range update `(i, j, x)` can be recorded in O(1) time in a difference array: `diff[i] += x` and `diff[j+1] -= x`.
    - **Brief Explanation:** You create a difference array initialized to zeros. For each booking `(first, last, seats)`, you do `diff[first-1] += seats` and (if `last < n`) `diff[last] -= seats`. After processing all bookings, the final answer array is simply the prefix sum of this difference array.

## 12. Flood Fill Algorithm (DFS/BFS on Grids)

This algorithm "fills" a connected region of cells in a grid, much like the paint bucket tool in an image editor. It's a direct application of graph traversal—either Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS)—on a grid where each cell is a node and adjacent cells are its neighbors.

### The Core Idea

1. Start at a given cell `(row, col)`.
2. Check if this cell is a valid candidate for filling (e.g., it's within bounds and has the color you want to replace). If not, stop.
3. Change the cell's color to the new "fill" color. This is important to do _before_ recurring to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops.
4. Recursively call the function on all its valid neighbors (up, down, left, right).

### Visual Diagram & Trace (DFS Approach)

Fill the region of `1`'s with color `2`, starting at `(1, 1)`.

**Initial Grid:**

```
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1]]
```

**Call Stack:**

1. `fill(1,1)`: Color is `1`. Change it to `2`. Call `fill(0,1)`.
2. `fill(0,1)`: Color is `1`. Change it to `2`. Call `fill(-1,1)` (invalid, returns), call `fill(0,0)`.
3. `fill(0,0)`: Color is `1`. Change it to `2`. Call `fill(-1,0)` (invalid), call `fill(1,0)`.
4. `fill(1,0)`: Color is `1`. Change it to `2`. ...and so on.

The process spreads like a fire until it hits boundaries or cells of a different color.

**Final Grid:**

```
[[2, 2, 2],
 [2, 2, 0],
 [2, 0, 1]]
```

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(RtimesC) where R and C are the number of rows and columns. In the worst case, you visit every cell once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(RtimesC) for the recursion stack (DFS) or queue (BFS) in the worst case (a grid full of the same color).

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)
- **Description:** Given a coordinate, a new color, and an image represented by a grid, "flood fill" the image.

#### Python Code Solution (DFS approach)

Python

```python
def floodFill(image: list[list[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    
    rows, cols = len(image), len(image[0])
    original_color = image[sr][sc]

    # If the start color is already the new color, no work is needed.
    if original_color == color:
        return image

    def dfs(r, c):
        # Check if we are out of bounds OR if the current cell is not the one we want to fill.
        if not (0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols) or image[r][c] != original_color:
            return

        # Change the color (mark as visited)
        image[r][c] = color

        # Recursively call on all 4 neighbors
        dfs(r + 1, c) # Down
        dfs(r - 1, c) # Up
        dfs(r, c + 1) # Right
        dfs(r, c - 1) # Left

    dfs(sr, sc)
    return image
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Count disconnected groups of '1's.
    - **Logic Change:** Instead of just filling one area, you need to find and count how many times you have to _start_ a new fill.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Loop through every cell. If you find a '1', increment an `island_count` and then call your flood fill (DFS/BFS) function on that cell. The fill function's job is to "sink" the entire island (e.g., change all its '1's to '0's or another character) so you don't count it again.
        
2. **[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the size of the largest island.
    - **Logic Change:** The fill function needs to report back the size of the area it filled.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Similar to "Number of Islands", but your DFS/BFS function should return the number of cells it visited (`1 + dfs() + dfs() ...`). Keep a `max_area` variable and update it with the result of each new fill you start.

## 13. Hashing (Maps, Sets, Frequency Count)

Hashing is not a single algorithm but a fundamental **technique** used to solve a vast range of problems. The core idea is to use a data structure (a Hash Map or Hash Set) that allows for extremely fast, near-constant time **O(1)** lookups, insertions, and deletions.

### The Core Idea

A hash function takes an item (like a number, a string) and converts it into an index (a "hash code"). This index is used to store the item in an array-like structure. This way, instead of searching through the whole structure, you can go directly to the correct index to find, add, or remove your item.

- **Hash Map (or Dictionary in Python):** Stores `key: value` pairs. Perfect for frequency counting (`{number: count}`) or storing relationships (`{node: parent}`).
- **Hash Set (or Set in Python):** Stores only unique keys. Perfect for checking for duplicates or keeping track of items you've already seen.

### Visual Diagram

Problem: Count the frequency of characters in "hello".

Data Structure: Hash Map (Python Dictionary)

1. `'h'`: Not in map. Add it. `map = {'h': 1}`
2. `'e'`: Not in map. Add it. `map = {'h': 1, 'e': 1}`
3. `'l'`: Not in map. Add it. `map = {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}`
4. `'l'`: Is in map. Increment its value. `map = {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2}`
5. `'o'`: Not in map. Add it. `map = {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}`

Final map gives the frequency of each character.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) on average for insertion, deletion, and lookup. In the worst case (many "hash collisions"), it can degrade to O(N), but this is rare with good hash functions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store N items in the map/set.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- **Description:** Given an array of integers `nums` and a target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def twoSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    # Use a hash map to store `value: index` pairs.
    num_map = {} 
    
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if the complement we need exists in the map.
        # This lookup is O(1) on average.
        if complement in num_map:
            # If it exists, we found our pair.
            return [num_map[complement], index]
        
        # If complement is not found, store the current number and its index.
        num_map[num] = index
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Determine if an array contains any duplicate values
    - **Logic Change:** A Hash Set is perfect for this.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Iterate through the array. For each number, try to add it to a hash set. If the number is already in the set, you've found a duplicate and can return `True`. If you finish the loop without finding duplicates, return `False`.
        
2. **[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Group a list of strings by anagrams.
    - **Logic Change:** You need a way to create a canonical key for each anagram group. A sorted string is a perfect key.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Create a hash map where the `key` is a sorted string and the `value` is a list of its anagrams. Iterate through the input strings. For each string, sort it to create the key, and append the original string to the list associated with that key in the map. The values of the map will be the final grouped anagrams.
