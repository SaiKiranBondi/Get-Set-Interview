## 16. Heap / Priority Queue

A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is perfect for when you repeatedly need to find and extract the minimum or maximum element from a collection. It's the underlying structure for the **Priority Queue** abstract data type.

- **Min-Heap:** The parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children. The smallest element in the collection is always at the root.
- **Max-Heap:** The parent node is always larger than or equal to its children. The largest element is always at the root.

### The Core Idea

Whenever you add an element, it's placed at the end and "bubbles up" to its correct position to maintain the heap property. When you remove the top element (the min or max), the last element takes its place and "sinks down" to its correct position. These operations are very fast.

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Min-Heap)

1. **Push(10):**
    
    ```
        (10)
    ```
    
2. **Push(4):**
    
    ```
        (10)      ->      (4)
        /               /
       (4)             (10)   // 4 bubbles up
    ```
    
3. **Push(5):**
    
    ```
        (4)             (4)
        / \             / \
      (10) (5)   ->   (10) (5) // 5 is in the correct spot
    ```
    
4. **Pop() (removes 4):**
    
    - Remove `4`. Move last element `5` to the root.
        
    - `5` is smaller than its child `10`, so it's in the right place.
        
    
    ```
        (5)             (5)
        / \      ->     /
      (10) (5)          (10)
    ```
    
    - Returns `4`. Heap is now `[5, 10]`.
### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:**
    
    - Insertion (`push`): O(logN)
    - Deletion of min/max (`pop`): O(logN)
    - Viewing min/max (`peek`): O(1)
    - Building a heap from an array (`heapify`): O(N)
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the elements.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)
- **Description:** Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th largest element.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
import heapq

def findKthLargest(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the Kth largest element using a Min-Heap of size K.
    """
    # In Python, heapq implements a Min-Heap.
    min_heap = []
    
    for num in nums:
        # Push the current number into the heap.
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        
        # If the heap size exceeds K, it means the smallest element
        # in the heap is NOT one of the top K largest elements. So, remove it.
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            
    # After the loop, the heap contains the K largest elements,
    # and the root (min_heap[0]) is the Kth largest.
    return min_heap[0]
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)**
    
    - **Variation:** The problem is framed as a class that handles a continuous stream of incoming numbers.
    - **Logic Change:** The core logic is identical. The heap is stored as a class member.
    - **Brief Explanation:** The `__init__` method builds the initial heap of size `k`. The `add` method performs the exact same logic as one iteration of the loop in the solution above: push the new element, and if the heap is too big, pop the smallest.
    
2. **[347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the `k` most frequent elements, not the `k` largest values.
    - **Logic Change:** You need to count frequencies first. The heap will store pairs of `(frequency, number)`.
    - **Brief Explanation:** First, use a hash map to get the frequency of each number. Then, iterate through the `(number, frequency)` pairs from the map. Use a min-heap of size `k` to keep track of the top `k` elements based on their frequency.
        
3. **[295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the median of a constantly growing list of numbers.
    - **Logic Change:** Use two heaps to partition the numbers: a **Max-Heap** for the smaller half and a **Min-Heap** for the larger half.
    - **Brief Explanation:** Keep the two heaps balanced in size (or off by at most one). When a new number arrives, add it to the appropriate heap and then rebalance by moving an element from one heap to the other if necessary. The median is either the top of the larger heap or the average of the tops of both heaps.

## 17. Monotonic Stack

A monotonic stack is a variation of a regular stack that maintains a specific order among its elements. The elements in the stack are always either in **monotonically increasing** or **monotonically decreasing** order from bottom to top.

- **Monotonically Increasing Stack:** Every element is greater than or equal to the element below it. `[1, 5, 8, 10]`
    
- **Monotonically Decreasing Stack:** Every element is less than or equal to the element below it. `[10, 8, 5, 1]`
    

This structure is not used for storing data permanently but as a tool to process other data structures, like an array. It's the key to solving problems involving finding the "next greater/smaller element" or "previous greater/smaller element" for each item in an array.

### The Core Idea

The main logic revolves around one rule: **Before you push a new element onto the stack, you must first pop all elements from the top that violate the monotonic property.**

Let's consider a **monotonically decreasing stack** (used for "Next Greater Element" problems):

1. Iterate through the input array.
    
2. For each new element `x`:
    
    - Look at the element at the top of the stack (`stack_top`).
        
    - **While** the stack is not empty and `x` is greater than `stack_top`:
        
        - The current element `x` is the "Next Greater Element" for `stack_top`.
            
        - Pop `stack_top` from the stack.
            
    - After the loop, push the current element `x` (or its index) onto the stack.
        

This process ensures the stack always remains in decreasing order.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Problem: Find the Next Greater Element for each number in [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3].

Tool: A monotonically decreasing stack.

|Current Element|Stack (Bottom -> Top)|Action|Result|
|---|---|---|---|
|**2**|`[]`|Stack is empty. Push `2`.|`deque([2])`|
|**1**|`[2]`|`1 < 2`. Property holds. Push `1`.|`deque([2, 1])`|
|**5**|`[2, 1]`|`5 > 1`. Pop `1`. `NextGreater(1) = 5`.|`deque([2])`|
||`[2]`|`5 > 2`. Pop `2`. `NextGreater(2) = 5`.|`deque([])`|
||`[]`|Stack is empty. Push `5`.|`deque([5])`|
|**6**|`[5]`|`6 > 5`. Pop `5`. `NextGreater(5) = 6`.|`deque([])`|
||`[]`|Stack is empty. Push `6`.|`deque([6])`|
|**2**|`[6]`|`2 < 6`. Property holds. Push `2`.|`deque([6, 2])`|
|**3**|`[6, 2]`|`3 > 2`. Pop `2`. `NextGreater(2) = 3`.|`deque([6])`|
||`[6]`|`3 < 6`. Property holds. Push `3`.|`deque([6, 3])`|
|**End**|`[6, 3]`|Elements left have no greater element.||

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N). This is the key advantage. Although there is a nested `while` loop, each element is pushed onto the stack exactly once and popped from the stack exactly once. Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to `N`.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case, where all elements are pushed onto the stack (e.g., a sorted decreasing array).
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)
    
- **Description:** You are given two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`. For each element in `nums1`, find its "next greater element" in `nums2`.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def nextGreaterElement(nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    # Use a hash map to store the next greater element for each number in nums2.
    next_greater_map = {}
    
    # Use a monotonically decreasing stack.
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate through nums2 to populate the map.
    for num in nums2:
        # While stack is not empty and the current number is greater than the stack's top
        while stack and num > stack[-1]:
            # The current number is the next greater element for the stack's top.
            popped_element = stack.pop()
            next_greater_map[popped_element] = num
        
        # Push the current number onto the stack.
        stack.append(num)
        
    # For any numbers left in the stack, they have no next greater element.
    while stack:
        next_greater_map[stack.pop()] = -1
        
    # Build the result array by looking up values from nums1 in our map.
    result = [next_greater_map[num] for num in nums1]
    
    return result
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Given a list of daily temperatures, return an array where `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature.
        
    - **Logic Change:** This is a "next greater element" problem. The stack should store the _indices_ of the days, not the temperatures themselves.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Iterate through the temperatures with their indices. When you find a temperature `T[i]` that is warmer than the temperature at the index on top of the stack (`T[stack_top]`), you can calculate the waiting days: `i - stack_top`.
        
2. **[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)**
    
    - **Variation:** A much harder problem. Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within a histogram.
        
    - **Logic Change:** For each bar `h`, the largest rectangle using that bar's height extends as far left and right as possible to bars that are at least as tall as `h`. This means we need to find the "next smaller element" and "previous smaller element" for each bar.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** A **monotonically increasing stack** is used. When you encounter a bar `h[i]` that is smaller than the bar at the top of the stack (`h[stack_top]`), it means `h[i]` is the "next smaller element" for `h[stack_top]`. The "previous smaller element" for `h[stack_top]` is whatever is now below it on the stack. With these two boundaries, you can calculate the area for the rectangle with height `h[stack_top]` and pop it.
        
3. **[901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Implement a class that collects daily stock prices and returns the "span" for the current day. The span is the maximum number of consecutive days (including today) for which the price was less than or equal to today's price.
        
    - **Logic Change:** This is a "previous greater element" problem.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Use a monotonically decreasing stack that stores pairs of `(price, span)`. When a new `price` arrives, pop all elements from the stack that are less than or equal to the new `price`, accumulating their spans as you go. The total accumulated span plus 1 (for the current day) is the new span. Push `(new_price, new_span)` onto the stack.

## 18. Counting Sort & Bucket Sort

These are special-purpose, non-comparison-based sorting algorithms. They can be much faster than algorithms like Merge Sort, but they only work under specific conditions.

### Counting Sort

**Core Idea:** Works extremely well when the range of input values (`K`) is not significantly larger than the number of elements (`N`). It counts the occurrences of each distinct element and uses those counts to calculate the final sorted positions.

**Visual Diagram & Trace:** Sort `[1, 4, 1, 2, 7, 5, 2]`

1. **Find Max:** Max value is `7`.
2. **Create Count Array** of size `8` (0-7): `[0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]` (e.g., there are two `1`s, two `2`s, etc.)
3. **Build Result:** Iterate through the count array. Add `0` zero times. Add `1` two times. Add `2` two times...
    - Result: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 7]`

**Complexities:**

- Time: O(N+K)
- Space: O(K)

**Core LeetCode Problem:** [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/) is a perfect example since `K=3`.

### Bucket Sort

**Core Idea:** Distributes elements into a number of "buckets." Each bucket is then sorted individually (e.g., with Insertion Sort). It's most effective when the input data is uniformly distributed.

**Visual Diagram & Trace:** Sort `[0.78, 0.17, 0.39, 0.26]` with 4 buckets.

1. **Create Buckets:** `B1: [0-0.24]`, `B2: [0.25-0.49]`, `B3: [0.5-0.74]`, `B4: [0.75-0.99]`
2. **Distribute:**
    
    - `B1: [0.17]`
    - `B2: [0.39, 0.26]`
    - `B3: []`
    - `B4: [0.78]`
    
3. **Sort Buckets:**
    
    - `B1: [0.17]`
    - `B2: [0.26, 0.39]`
    - `B3: []`
    - `B4: [0.78]`
        
4. **Concatenate:** `[0.17, 0.26, 0.39, 0.78]`    

**Complexities:**

- Average Time: O(N+K) (K=num buckets)
- Worst Time: O(N2) (if all elements go in one bucket)
- Space: O(N+K)

### LeetCode Problem & Solution (Counting Sort)

- **Problem:** [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
- **Description:** Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue (represented by `0`, `1`, `2`), sort them in-place.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def sortColors(nums: list[int]) -> None:
    """
    Sorts colors in-place using the Counting Sort idea.
    """
    counts = [0, 0, 0] # counts for 0s, 1s, and 2s

    # First pass: count the occurrences of each color
    for num in nums:
        counts[num] += 1
    
    # Second pass: overwrite the original array with the sorted values
    i = 0
    for color_val in range(3):
        for _ in range(counts[color_val]):
            nums[i] = color_val
            i += 1
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[1122. Relative Sort Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Sort `arr1` based on the order of elements in `arr2`. Elements not in `arr2` go at the end, sorted.
    - **Logic Change:** Counting sort is the key. The count array helps you place elements.
    - **Brief Explanation:** First, create a frequency map (count array) for `arr1`. Then, iterate through `arr2`. For each element in `arr2`, append it to your result list as many times as it appears in the frequency map and set its count to 0. Finally, iterate through the frequency map (from 0 to 1000) and append the remaining elements with non-zero counts.
        
2. **[164. Maximum Gap](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-gap/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the maximum difference between successive elements in sorted form, but in linear time.
    - **Logic Change:** Uses the principles of Bucket Sort (pigeonhole principle).
    - **Brief Explanation:** You don't need to fully sort. Calculate an ideal bucket size. Distribute numbers into buckets, but only store the `min` and `max` value for each bucket. The maximum gap is guaranteed to occur _between_ the `max` of one bucket and the `min` of the next non-empty bucket.

## 19. Binary Search on Answer

This is a powerful technique for optimization problems that ask for the "minimum possible maximum" or "maximum possible minimum" value that satisfies a certain condition. Instead of searching for an _item_ in an array, you are searching for the _answer_ itself within a range of possible answers.

### The Core Idea

1. **Define a Search Space:** Determine the smallest and largest possible values for your answer.
2. **Create a `check` function:** This is the most crucial part. Write a function `check(potential_answer)` that returns `True` or `False`. It answers the question: "Is it possible to satisfy the main condition if our answer was `potential_answer`?" This check function usually takes O(N) time.
3. **Binary Search:** Perform a binary search on the answer space. If `check(mid)` is true, it means `mid` is a possible answer, so you try to do better (e.g., find a smaller value) by narrowing the search space. If it's false, `mid` is not a valid answer, so you must search for a larger value.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

Problem: Find the minimum speed to eat all bananas in H hours.

Search Space for Speed: [1, 2, 3, ..., max_pile]

check(speed): Can we finish in H hours with this speed?

Let's say check(5) is True (we can finish). This means any speed > 5 also works. 5 is a possible answer, but maybe a smaller speed like 4 or 3 also works. So, we search in [1...5].

Let's say check(2) is False (we can't finish). This means 2 is too slow. We must go faster. So, we search in [3...5].

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(NlogK) where `K` is the size of the answer search space and O(N) is the complexity of the `check` function.

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)
- **Description:** Find the minimum integer `k` (eating speed) such that Koko can eat all bananas in all piles within `h` hours.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
import math

def minEatingSpeed(piles: list[int], h: int) -> int:
    # The search space for the answer (speed k) is from 1 to the max pile size.
    left, right = 1, max(piles)
    res = right # Keep track of the best valid answer found so far

    def check(speed):
        """Can Koko finish with this speed?"""
        hours_needed = 0
        for p in piles:
            hours_needed += math.ceil(p / speed)
        return hours_needed <= h

    while left <= right:
        mid_speed = (left + right) // 2
        
        if check(mid_speed):
            # This speed works. It's a potential answer.
            # Let's see if we can do better (a slower speed).
            res = mid_speed
            right = mid_speed - 1
        else:
            # This speed is too slow. We must go faster.
            left = mid_speed + 1
            
    return res
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the least weight capacity for a ship to transport all packages in D days.
    - **Logic Change:** The structure is identical to Koko. The "speed" is "capacity", "piles" are "weights", and "hours" are "days".
    - **Brief Explanation:** The search space is for the ship's capacity. The `check(capacity)` function simulates loading the ship and determines if it's possible to ship all packages in D days with the given capacity.
    
2. **[410. Split Array Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Split an array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays. Minimize the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.
    - **Logic Change:** The search space is for the answer (the maximum allowed sum for any subarray).
    - **Brief Explanation:** The `check(max_sum_allowed)` function greedily creates subarrays, ensuring no subarray's sum exceeds `max_sum_allowed`. It then returns whether the number of subarrays created is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, `max_sum_allowed` is a possible answer, and you try for a smaller one.
