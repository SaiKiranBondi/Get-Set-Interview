## 4. Selection Sort 🏆

Think of Selection Sort as finding the "best" candidate (the smallest number) in a lineup and moving them to the front, one by one.

### The Core Idea

The list is split into two parts: a **sorted** part on the left (initially empty) and an **unsorted** part on the right. In each round, we _select_ the absolute smallest number from the unsorted part and swap it into the first position of that unsorted part, making the sorted part one element bigger.

[ Sorted Part | Unsorted Part ]

### Trace for an Example: `[64, 25, 12, 22]`

1. **Round 1:**
    - `[ | 64, 25, 12, 22 ]`
    - **Scan** the unsorted part `(64, 25, 12, 22)`. The smallest is `12`.
    - **Swap** `12` with the first element of the unsorted part (`64`).
    - Result: `[ 12 | 25, 64, 22 ]`
2. **Round 2:**
    - `[ 12 | 25, 64, 22 ]`
    - **Scan** the new unsorted part `(25, 64, 22)`. The smallest is `22`.
    - **Swap** `22` with the first element of the unsorted part (`25`).
    - Result: `[ 12, 22 | 64, 25 ]`
3. **Round 3:**
    - `[ 12, 22 | 64, 25 ]`
    - **Scan** `(64, 25)`. The smallest is `25`.
    - **Swap** `25` with `64`.
    - Result: `[ 12, 22, 25 | 64 ]`

The list is now sorted!

### LeetCode Solution

This method correctly solves [LeetCode 912. Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/), although it's too slow for large inputs.

Python

```python
def sortArray(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    n = len(nums)
    # The outer loop determines the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts
    for i in range(n):
        # Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[j] < nums[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j
        
        # Swap the minimum element into its correct sorted position
        nums[i], nums[min_idx] = nums[min_idx], nums[i]
        
    return nums
```

## 5. Insertion Sort 🃏

Think of Insertion Sort like organizing a hand of playing cards. You keep your cards sorted, and each time you pick up a new card, you slide it into its correct spot.

### The Core Idea

The list is again split into a **sorted** part (your "hand") and an **unsorted** part (the "draw pile"). You take the first card from the draw pile and compare it to the cards in your hand, moving from right to left. You shift the bigger cards over to make a gap and then _insert_ your new card.

[ Sorted Hand | Draw Pile ]

### Trace for an Example: `[12, 11, 13, 5]`

1. **Round 1:**
    - Hand: `[ 12 ]`. Draw Pile: `[ | 11, 13, 5 ]`.
    - **Pick** `11`. It's smaller than `12`.
    - **Shift** `12` to the right, creating a gap. Insert `11`.
    - Result: `[ 11, 12 | 13, 5 ]`
2. **Round 2:**
    - Hand: `[ 11, 12 ]`. Draw Pile: `[ | 13, 5 ]`.
    - **Pick** `13`. It's bigger than `12`, so it's already in the right place. No shifts needed.
    - Result: `[ 11, 12, 13 | 5 ]`
3. **Round 3:**
    - Hand: `[ 11, 12, 13 ]`. Draw Pile: `[ | 5 ]`.
    - **Pick** `5`. It's smaller than `13`, `12`, and `11`.
    - **Shift** `13`, `12`, and `11` all one spot to the right. Insert `5` at the beginning.
    - Result: `[ 5, 11, 12, 13 | ]`

The list is now sorted!

### LeetCode Solution

This is a great approach for [LeetCode 147. Insertion Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/) because inserting nodes in a linked list is efficient.

Python

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def insertionSortList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummy = ListNode(0) # `dummy` is the start of our sorted "hand"
    current = head      # `current` is the new "card" we're picking

    while current:
        prev = dummy # Start scanning our hand from the beginning
        
        # Find the correct spot to insert the `current` card
        while prev.next and prev.next.val < current.val:
            prev = prev.next
        
        # Save the next card from the pile before we move `current`
        next_to_insert = current.next
        
        # Insert `current` into the gap
        current.next = prev.next
        prev.next = current
        
        # Move on to the next card in the pile
        current = next_to_insert
        
    return dummy.next
```

## 6. Merge Sort 🌲

Merge Sort is a classic **Divide and Conquer** algorithm. The strategy is to break a big, difficult problem into smaller, easy-to-solve problems and then combine the results.

### The Core Idea

1. **Divide:** Keep splitting the list in half until you can't anymore. You'll be left with a bunch of lists with only one element each. A single-element list is, by definition, already sorted.
2. **Conquer (Merge):** Take two of your tiny sorted lists and merge them into a new, bigger sorted list. Repeat this process, merging your sorted lists back together until you're left with just one, fully sorted list.

### Visual Diagram: `[38, 27, 43, 3]`

```
       [38, 27, 43, 3]
              |
      <-- DIVIDE -->
             /  \
    [38, 27]      [43, 3]
       |             |
      / \           / \
   [38] [27]     [43] [3]
      \ /           \ /
       |             |
    <-- MERGE -->
       |             |
    [27, 38]      [3, 43]
             \  /
              |
           [3, 27, 38, 43]
```

### LeetCode Solution

Merge Sort's reliable O(NlogN) performance makes it an excellent choice for [LeetCode 912. Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/).

Python

```python
def sortArray(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    # This is the base case for the recursion.
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return nums

    # 1. DIVIDE
    mid = len(nums) // 2
    left_half = sortArray(nums[:mid])  # Recursively sort left half
    right_half = sortArray(nums[mid:]) # Recursively sort right half

    # 2. CONQUER (Merge the two sorted halves)
    return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left: list[int], right: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Helper function to merge two sorted lists."""
    sorted_list = []
    i = j = 0 # Pointers for left and right lists

    # Compare elements and append the smaller one
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            sorted_list.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_list.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Append any remaining elements
    sorted_list.extend(left[i:])
    sorted_list.extend(right[j:])
    
    return sorted_list
```

## 7. Quick Sort ⚡

Quick Sort is another powerful **Divide and Conquer** sorting algorithm. Its genius lies in its partitioning step: it picks an element as a **pivot** and rearranges the array so that all smaller elements are to the pivot's left, and all larger elements are to its right. This puts the pivot in its final sorted position.

### The Core Idea

1. **Pick a Pivot:** Choose any element from the array to be the pivot (e.g., the last element).
2. **Partition:** Rearrange the array so that the pivot is in its correct sorted place. Everything smaller is to its left; everything larger is to its right.
3. **Recurse:** Apply Quick Sort recursively to the sub-array on the left of the pivot and the sub-array on the right.

### Visual Diagram: Partitioning `[7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]`

Let's pick `4` as the pivot (it's the last element).

```
Initial:  [ 7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3 | 4 ]
                                 ^ Pivot

Goal: Move everything < 4 to the left, and > 4 to the right.

Result of Partition: [ 2, 1, 3 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 7, 6, 8, 5 ]
                       <--Less-->  ^      <--Greater-->
                                Sorted
```

Now, you'd recursively run Quick Sort on `[2, 1, 3]` and `[7, 6, 8, 5]`.

### Complexities

- **Best Case Time:** O(NlogN)
    - This happens when the pivot always splits the array into two nearly equal halves.
- **Average Case Time:** O(NlogN)
    - Even with "unlucky" pivots, it averages out to be highly efficient.
- **Worst Case Time:** O(N2)
    - This happens when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element (e.g., picking the last element of an already sorted array). The "partitions" become a single element and an N-1 element array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(logN) on average for the recursion call stack.

### LeetCode Solution

Quick Sort is an excellent in-place sorting method for [LeetCode 912. Sort an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/).

Python

```python
def sortArray(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    """Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm."""
    
    def quick_sort(low, high):
        if low < high:
            # pi is the partitioning index, nums[pi] is now at the right place
            pi = partition(low, high)
            
            # Separately sort elements before partition and after partition
            quick_sort(low, pi - 1)
            quick_sort(pi + 1, high)

    def partition(low, high):
        # Choosing the last element as the pivot
        pivot = nums[high]
        i = low - 1  # Index of smaller element

        for j in range(low, high):
            # If current element is smaller than the pivot
            if nums[j] <= pivot:
                i = i + 1
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        
        # Place the pivot in its correct position
        nums[i + 1], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i + 1]
        return i + 1

    quick_sort(0, len(nums) - 1)
    return nums
```
