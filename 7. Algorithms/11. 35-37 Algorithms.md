## 35. Suffix Arrays and LCP Array

These are advanced data structures used for complex string processing tasks. They provide a powerful way to answer questions about substrings, repetitions, and commonalities within a single string or between multiple strings.

- **Suffix Array:** This is an array of integers that gives the starting positions of all suffixes of a string, after those suffixes have been sorted lexicographically (alphabetically).
    
- **LCP (Longest Common Prefix) Array:** This array is almost always used with a Suffix Array. `lcp[i]` stores the length of the longest common prefix between the suffixes at `suffix_array[i]` and `suffix_array[i-1]`.
    

### The Core Idea

By sorting all suffixes, we group similar substrings together. The LCP array then quantifies just how similar adjacent suffixes in this sorted list are. The largest value in the LCP array, for instance, points to the longest repeated substring in the original string.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**String `s = "banana"`**

1. **Generate all suffixes:**
    
    ```
    Index 0: banana
    Index 1: anana
    Index 2: nana
    Index 3: ana
    Index 4: na
    Index 5: a
    ```
    
2. **Sort the suffixes alphabetically:**
    
    ```
    a
    ana
    anana
    banana
    na
    nana
    ```
    
3. Build the Suffix Array (the original starting indices of the sorted suffixes):
    
    Suffix Array = [5, 3, 1, 0, 4, 2]
    
4. **Build the LCP Array** (compare adjacent suffixes in the sorted list):
    
    - `LCP(a, ana)` = 1 ("a")
        
    - `LCP(ana, anana)` = 3 ("ana")
        
    - `LCP(anana, banana)` = 0 (no common prefix)
        
    - `LCP(banana, na)` = 0 (no common prefix)
        
    - `LCP(na, nana)` = 2 ("na")
        
    - `LCP Array = [?, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2]` (index 0 is often undefined)
        

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** Building both arrays can be done in O(NlogN) or even O(N) with highly advanced algorithms.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for both arrays.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

While building a suffix array is too complex for most interviews, problems that _use_ its properties appear.

- **Problem:** [1044. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/)
    
- **Description:** Given a string `s`, find the longest duplicated substring. If one doesn't exist, return `""`.
    

#### Python Code Solution (Conceptual using Rabin-Karp)

_Note: A true Suffix Array solution is very long. The standard competitive programming solution uses Rabin-Karp with Binary Search, which solves the same class of problems._

Python

```
# A Suffix Array solution is too complex to write from scratch in an interview.
# The intended solution for this problem on LeetCode combines Rabin-Karp (to check)
# and Binary Search on Answer (to find the length).

# Conceptual Logic using Suffix/LCP arrays:
# 1. Build the Suffix Array for the string.
# 2. Build the LCP array from the Suffix Array.
# 3. Find the maximum value in the LCP array. This 'max_lcp' is the length of the longest duplicate substring.
# 4. Find the index 'i' where this max_lcp occurs.
# 5. The answer is the substring of length 'max_lcp' starting at `suffix_array[i]`.
```

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()

# print(sol.longestDupSubstring("abcd"))   # Output: ""

```
### LeetCode Variants

1. **Number of Distinct Substrings:** This can be calculated from the suffix and LCP arrays. The total number of substrings is `N*(N+1)/2`. The number of duplicate substrings (which we need to subtract) can be found by summing all values in the LCP array. So, `Distinct = Total - Sum(LCP)`.

## 36. Manacher's Algorithm

This is a very clever linear-time (O(N)) algorithm specifically designed to solve the **Longest Palindromic Substring** problem. Standard DP or "expand from center" approaches are O(N2), so Manacher's is a significant optimization.

### The Core Idea

The algorithm overcomes two challenges: handling both even and odd-length palindromes, and avoiding re-computation.

1. **Transform String:** It transforms the string to handle odd/even cases uniformly. `aba` becomes `#a#b#a#` and `abba` becomes `#a#b#b#a#`. Now, every possible palindrome (odd or even) is centered at a character in the new string and has an odd length.
    
2. **Expand and Reuse:** It maintains the `center` and `right` boundary of the palindrome that reaches furthest to the right. When computing the palindrome radius for a new position `i` that is _within_ this boundary, it can use information from `i`'s "mirror" position on the other side of the `center` to get a head start, avoiding redundant character comparisons.
    

### Visual Diagram & Trace

String s = "abacaba" -> Transformed T = #a#b#a#c#a#b#a#

We compute P, an array where P[i] is the radius of the palindrome centered at T[i].

`Center (C) = 0, Right Boundary (R) = 0`

- `i=1`: `T[1] = 'a'`. Palindrome is `a`. Radius is 1. `P[1]=1`. `R` is now `1+1=2`. `C` is `1`.
    
- `i=2`: `T[2] = '#'`. Palindrome is `#`. Radius is 0. `P[2]=0`.
    
- `i=3`: `T[3] = 'b'`. Palindrome is `b`. Radius is 1. `P[3]=1`. `R` is now `3+1=4`. `C` is `3`.
    
- ...
    
- `i=7`: `T[7] = 'c'`. Palindrome is `c`. Radius is 1. `P[7]=1`. `R` is now `7+1=8`. `C` is `7`.
    
- `i=8`: We are inside the `[C,R]` boundary (`[7,8]`). `i`'s mirror is `2*C - i = 14-8=6`.
    
    - We can initialize `P[8]` with `P[6]`.
        
    - ...and continue expanding.
        

This "mirroring" trick is what allows the algorithm to skip checks and achieve linear time.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the transformed string and the radii array.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
    
- **Description:** Find the longest substring which is a palindrome.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    # Transform S into T.
    # For example, S = "abba", T = "#a#b#b#a#"
    T = '#'.join(f'^{s}$')
    n = len(T)
    P = [0] * n
    C = R = 0 # Center and Right boundary

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        # Find the mirror of i
        i_mirror = 2 * C - i
        
        # If i is within the right boundary, we can reuse information
        if R > i:
            P[i] = min(R - i, P[i_mirror])
        else:
            P[i] = 0
            
        # Attempt to expand palindrome centered at i
        while T[i + 1 + P[i]] == T[i - 1 - P[i]]:
            P[i] += 1
            
        # If palindrome centered at i expands past R,
        # adjust center and right boundary
        if i + P[i] > R:
            C = i
            R = i + P[i]

    # Find the maximum element in P.
    max_len = max(P)
    center_index = P.index(max_len)
    
    # Convert an index in T back to an index in S
    start = (center_index - max_len) // 2
    return s[start : start + max_len]
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Count how many palindromic substrings are in a string.
        
    - **Logic Change:** The Manacher's `P` array directly helps here.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** After computing the `P` array, the number of palindromes centered at `T[i]` is `(P[i] + 1) // 2`. Summing this value for all `i` gives the total count of palindromic substrings.

## 37. Shortest Path in a DAG

Finding the shortest path in a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a special case that can be solved more efficiently than with Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford. Since there are no cycles, we can process nodes in a linear order that guarantees we've found the shortest path to a node before we use it to update its neighbors.

### The Core Idea

1. **Topologically Sort** the graph. This gives a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge from `u` to `v`, vertex `u` comes before vertex `v` in the ordering.
    
2. **Initialize** a `distances` array with infinity for all nodes and 0 for the `source` node.
    
3. **Iterate and Relax:** Go through the nodes one by one in the topological order. For each node `u`, "relax" all its outgoing edges. Relaxing edge `(u, v)` with weight `w` means checking if `dist[u] + w` is a shorter path to `v` than the current `dist[v]`.
    

Because we process in topological order, when we are at node `u`, we are guaranteed that `dist[u]` is the final, shortest-path distance.

### Visual Diagram & Trace

**Goal:** Find shortest paths from **A**.

```
    (3)     (6)
  A ----> B ----> E
  | \     |       ^
(2)|  \ (2)|       | (1)
  |   \   |       |
  v    >  v       |
  C ----> D-------
    (4)
```

1. **Topological Sort:** `[A, C, B, D, E]`
    
2. **Initialize `dist`:** `[A:0, B:inf, C:inf, D:inf, E:inf]`
    
3. **Process `A`:**
    
    - `dist[B] = min(inf, 0+3) = 3`
        
    - `dist[C] = min(inf, 0+2) = 2`
        
    - `dist[D] = min(inf, 0+2) = 2` (via A->B->D) _Correction: this path is taken later_
        
    - `dist[D]` update is incorrect here. Relax `A->D` edge. Let's assume there is no `A->D` edge for clarity. Let's say A only connects to B and C. `dist = [A:0, B:3, C:2, D:inf, E:inf]`
        
4. **Process `C`:**
    
    - `dist[D] = min(inf, dist[C]+4) = min(inf, 2+4) = 6`
        
    - `dist = [A:0, B:3, C:2, D:6, E:inf]`
        
5. **Process `B`:**
    
    - `dist[D] = min(6, dist[B]+2) = min(6, 3+2) = 5`
        
    - `dist[E] = min(inf, dist[B]+6) = min(inf, 3+6) = 9`
        
    - `dist = [A:0, B:3, C:2, D:5, E:9]`
        
6. **Process `D`:**
    
    - `dist[E] = min(9, dist[D]+1) = min(9, 5+1) = 6`
        
    - `dist = [A:0, B:3, C:2, D:5, E:6]`
        
7. **Process `E`:** No outgoing edges.
    

**Final Distances:** `{A:0, B:3, C:2, D:5, E:6}`

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(V+E), dominated by the topological sort.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(V+E) for the graph representation and supporting arrays.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** This is a fundamental algorithm, often a building block. Many DP on grid problems can be modeled this way. A good conceptual fit is [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/), but only if you are _guaranteed_ the graph is a DAG. The general solution uses Dijkstra.
    
- **Description:** A more common application is finding the **longest path** in a DAG (critical for project planning). This is done by negating all edge weights and then finding the shortest path.
    

#### Python Code Solution (Conceptual)

Python

```python
# Assuming adj list, topological_order, and source are given
def shortestPathInDAG(adj, topological_order, source, V):
    dist = [float('inf')] * V
    dist[source] = 0

    # Process vertices in topological order
    for u in topological_order:
        # Update distances of all adjacent vertices
        if dist[u] != float('inf'):
            for v, weight in adj[u]:
                if dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
    
    return dist
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the path with the maximum product of probabilities.
        
    - **Logic Change:** If the graph is a DAG, you can adapt this algorithm. Instead of minimizing sum, you maximize a product.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Initialize distances to 0 (and source to 1). The relaxation step becomes `dist[v] = max(dist[v], dist[u] * probability(u,v))`. You must process in topological order.
        
2. **Many DP problems:** Problems like [931. Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/) can be viewed as finding the shortest path in a DAG where nodes are the grid cells and edges connect to valid next-step cells. The DP solution is equivalent to iterating through the nodes in topological order.
