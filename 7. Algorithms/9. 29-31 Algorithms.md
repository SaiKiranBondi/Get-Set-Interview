## 29. Dynamic Programming on Subsets (Knapsack, Subset Sum)

This DP pattern is used for problems where you need to select a subset of items to satisfy some condition or optimize some value. The core decision for each item is binary: either you **take it** or you **don't take it**.

### The Core Idea

You build a solution incrementally. The state `dp[i][j]` typically answers a question like, "What is the best result I can get using only the first `i` items, given constraint `j`?" To calculate `dp[i][j]`, you consider the `i`-th item:

1. **Don't take item `i`:** The solution is the same as if you only had `i-1` items, i.e., `dp[i-1][j]`.
    
2. **Take item `i`:** This is only possible if the item fits within constraint `j`. The solution would be `(value of item i) + (best result for i-1 items with remaining constraint j - weight[i])`.
    

You then take the best of these two choices.

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Subset Sum)

Problem: Can we find a subset of [1, 5, 11, 5] that sums to target = 11?

DP Table: dp[i][j] is True if a sum of j is possible using the first i numbers.

```
      j (sum) ->
i(item) 0   1   2   3   4   5   6 ... 11
  []  [ T,  F,  F,  F,  F,  F,  F ...  F]
  [1] [ T,  T,  F,  F,  F,  F,  F ...  F]  // Can make sum 1
  [5] [ T,  T,  F,  F,  F,  T,  T ...  F]  // Can make sum 5, and 1+5=6
 [11] [ T,  T,  F,  F,  F,  T,  T ...  T]  // Can make sum 11
  [5] [ T,  T,  F,  F,  F,  T,  T ...  T]  // Can make 5+5=10, 5+1=6. Can also make 11 from previous row.
```

Since `dp[4][11]` is `True`, the answer is yes.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(NtimesC) where N is the number of items and C is the target capacity/sum.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(NtimesC), which can be optimized to O(C) for many problems.
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)
    
- **Description:** Given an array of positive integers, find if it can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def canPartition(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If the total sum is odd, it's impossible to partition into two equal halves.
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
        
    target = total_sum // 2
    
    # dp[i] will be True if a subset with sum `i` can be formed.
    # This is the space-optimized version.
    dp = {0} # A set to store achievable sums. Start with 0.
    
    for num in nums:
        # Create a temporary set for new sums to avoid modifying while iterating.
        new_sums = set()
        for s in dp:
            new_sums.add(s + num)
        dp.update(new_sums)

        if target in dp:
            return True
            
    return target in dp
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[494. Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Assign either a `+` or `-` to each number to make the sum equal a target.
        
    - **Logic Change:** This can be converted to a subset sum problem. Let `S` be the target. The sum of the positive numbers (`P`) minus the sum of the negative numbers (`N`) must be `S`. `P - N = S`. We also know `P + N = total_sum`. Adding these gives `2P = S + total_sum`. So, the problem is to find a subset `P` that sums to `(S + total_sum) / 2`.
        
2. **[474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)**
    
    - **Variation:** This is a 2D Knapsack problem. You have two constraints (number of 0s and 1s) instead of one (weight).
        
    - **Logic Change:** The DP state becomes 2D: `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of strings you can form using `i` zeros and `j` ones.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** For each string, you count its zeros (`z`) and ones (`o`). Then you update the DP table: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i-z][j-o])`.

## 30. Dynamic Programming on Strings

This pattern is ideal for problems comparing two strings, such as finding their similarity or the cost of transforming one into the other. The DP state almost always relates to the prefixes of the strings.

### The Core Idea

The state `dp[i][j]` represents the solution for the prefix of string `s1` of length `i` (`s1[:i]`) and the prefix of string `s2` of length `j` (`s2[:j]`). The transition logic depends on the characters `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]`.

- **If `s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`:** The last characters match. You can often extend the solution from the smaller prefixes: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    
- **If `s1[i-1] != s2[j-1]`:** The last characters differ. You must perform an operation (like insert, delete, or replace) and take the best result from the subproblems: `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`.
    

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Edit Distance)

Problem: Min operations to convert "horse" to "ros".

DP Table: dp[i][j] is the min distance between s1[:i] and s2[:j].

```
      ""  r   o   s
""  [ 0,  1,  2,  3 ]
h   [ 1,  1,  2,  3 ] // h->r (replace), h->ro (replace,insert)...
o   [ 2,  2,  1,  2 ] // o==o, so dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] = 1
r   [ 3,  2,  2,  2 ]
s   [ 4,  3,  3,  2 ]
e   [ 5,  4,  4,  3 ] // e->s (replace), so dp[5][3] = 1+dp[4][2] = 1+2 = 3
```

Final answer is `dp[5][3] = 3`.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(MtimesN) where M and N are the lengths of the two strings.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(MtimesN), which can be optimized to O(min(M,N)).
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [1143. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
    
- **Description:** Find the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both strings.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    
    # dp[i][j] will store the LCS for text1[:i] and text2[:j]
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            # If characters match, we can extend the LCS from the previous state.
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            # If they don't match, the LCS is the best we could do without one of these characters.
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
                
    return dp[m][n]
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) to convert `word1` to `word2`.
        
    - **Logic Change:** This is the canonical example. If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`, corresponding to replace, delete, and insert.
        
2. **[5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the longest substring that is a palindrome.
        
    - **Logic Change:** The DP state is `dp[i][j]`, which is `True` if the substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** The transition is `dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) and dp[i+1][j-1]`. You check if the outer characters match and if the inner substring is also a palindrome. You must iterate by the length of the substring, from 1 to N.

## 31. Dynamic Programming on Grids

This pattern is used for problems on a 2D matrix or grid. The solution for a cell `(i, j)` typically depends on the solutions from the cells immediately above it (`i-1, j`) and/or to its left (`i, j-1`).

### The Core Idea

You build a DP table of the same dimensions as the input grid. `dp[i][j]` stores the answer to the subproblem ending at that cell. You fill the table, usually row by row or column by column, using a recurrence relation that combines the values from adjacent, previously computed cells.

- **For counting paths:** `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
    
- **For min/max path sum:** `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
    

### Visual Diagram & Trace (Unique Paths)

**Problem:** How many unique paths from `(0,0)` to `(2,2)` on a 3x3 grid, moving only right or down?

**DP Table:** `dp[i][j]` = number of paths to cell `(i,j)`.

```
[ 1, 1, 1 ]  // First row can only be reached from the left
[ 1, 2, 3 ]  // dp[1][1] = dp[0][1]+dp[1][0] = 1+1=2
[ 1, 3, 6 ]  // dp[2][2] = dp[1][2]+dp[2][1] = 3+3=6
```

The answer is `6`.

### Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(MtimesN) for an M x N grid.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(MtimesN), which can often be optimized to O(N) or O(1).
    

### Core LeetCode Problem & Solution

- **Problem:** [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
    
- **Description:** Find a path from top left to bottom right of a grid which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def minPathSum(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # We can solve this in-place, modifying the grid itself as our DP table.
    
    # Fill first row (can only come from the left)
    for j in range(1, n):
        grid[0][j] += grid[0][j-1]
        
    # Fill first column (can only come from the top)
    for i in range(1, m):
        grid[i][0] += grid[i-1][0]
        
    # Fill the rest of the grid
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
            
    # The bottom-right corner will have the final answer.
    return grid[m-1][n-1]
```

### LeetCode Variants

1. **[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)**
    
    - **Variation:** The classic path-counting problem.
        
    - **Logic Change:** The transition is addition: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Initialize the first row and column to all `1`s, as there is only one way to reach any of those cells. Then apply the addition formula for the rest of the grid.
        
2. **[120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)**
    
    - **Variation:** The grid is a triangle, not a rectangle. You can move from a cell `(i, j)` to `(i+1, j)` or `(i+1, j+1)`.
        
    - **Logic Change:** It's often easier to solve this bottom-up. The minimum path from a cell is its own value plus the minimum of the two cells directly below it.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** Start from the second-to-last row. For each cell, update its value: `triangle[i][j] += min(triangle[i+1][j], triangle[i+1][j+1])`. Work your way up to the top. The answer will be at `triangle[0][0]`.
        
3. **[221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)**
    
    - **Variation:** Find the largest square containing only '1's in a binary matrix.
        
    - **Logic Change:** The DP state is different: `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose _bottom-right corner_ is at `(i, j)`.
        
    - **Brief Explanation:** If `grid[i][j]` is '0', then `dp[i][j]` is 0. If `grid[i][j]` is '1', then the side length of the square is `1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`. You are limited by the smallest of the squares ending at your top, left, and top-left diagonal neighbors.
