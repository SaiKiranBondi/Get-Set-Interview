Of course! Let's start with the first three foundational algorithms: **Linear Search**, **Binary Search**, and **Bubble Sort**.

Here is a detailed breakdown for each one, following your requested format.

---

## 1. Linear Search 🕵️‍♀️

Linear search is the most basic search algorithm. It sequentially checks each element of a list from the beginning until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.

### Block Diagram (Flow)

```
Start
  |
  v
For each element in the list:
  |
  v
Is the current element == target?
  |
  |-- YES -> Return element's index -> End
  |
  v NO
Continue to next element
  |
  v
(After checking all elements)
  |
  v
Return "Not Found" (-1) -> End
```

### Trace for an Example

Let's trace a search for the `target = 70` in the array `[10, 50, 30, 70, 80, 20]`.

- **Step 1:** Compare `target` (70) with `array[0]` (10). They are not equal.
- **Step 2:** Compare `target` (70) with `array[1]` (50). They are not equal.
- **Step 3:** Compare `target` (70) with `array[2]` (30). They are not equal.
- **Step 4:** Compare `target` (70) with `array[3]` (70). **It's a match!**
- **Result:** The algorithm returns the index `3`.

### LeetCode Variant & Solution

A classic problem where the core idea of iterating and checking is used.

- **Problem:** [LeetCode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)
- **Description:** You are given a grid of bank accounts `accounts[i][j]` where `i` is the customer and `j` is the bank. Find the wealth of the richest customer. A customer's wealth is the sum of all their money.
- **Algorithm Application:** We must perform a linear scan through each customer to calculate their total wealth and then another linear scan to find the maximum wealth among all customers.

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def maximumWealth(accounts: list[list[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the maximum wealth among all customers.

    Args:
      accounts: A 2D list where accounts[i] is a list of the i-th customer's wealth.

    Returns:
      The maximum wealth found among all customers.
    """
    max_wealth_so_far = 0

    # Linearly iterate through each customer's list of accounts
    for customer_accounts in accounts:
        # Calculate the current customer's wealth by summing their accounts
        current_customer_wealth = sum(customer_accounts)

        # Check if this customer is richer than the richest found so far
        if current_customer_wealth > max_wealth_so_far:
            max_wealth_so_far = current_customer_wealth
    
    return max_wealth_so_far

# Example usage:
# accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
# print(maximumWealth(accounts)) # Output: 10
```

#### Code Explanation

1. We initialize a variable `max_wealth_so_far` to `0`. This will keep track of the highest wealth we've seen.
2. We loop through each `customer_accounts` list in the main `accounts` list. This is our first linear scan.
3. For each customer, we use the built-in `sum()` function to calculate their total wealth (`current_customer_wealth`). The `sum()` function itself performs a linear traversal over that customer's accounts.
4. We then compare `current_customer_wealth` to our `max_wealth_so_far` and update it if the current customer is richer.
5. After checking all customers, the value stored in `max_wealth_so_far` is the answer.

## 2. Binary Search 🎯

Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding an item from a **sorted** list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Block Diagram (Flow)

```
Start (with a sorted list)
  |
  v
Set left_pointer = 0, right_pointer = end_of_list
  |
  v
WHILE left_pointer <= right_pointer:
  |
  v
Calculate middle_index = (left + right) / 2
  |
  v
Is element at middle_index == target?
  |
  |-- YES -> Return middle_index -> End
  |
  v NO
  |
  v
Is element at middle_index < target?
  |
  |-- YES -> Move left_pointer to middle_index + 1
  |
  v NO (element is > target)
  |
  v
Move right_pointer to middle_index - 1
  |
  v
(Loop ends)
  |
  v
Return "Not Found" (-1) -> End
```

### Trace for an Example

Let's trace a search for the `target = 40` in the **sorted** array `[11, 22, 30, 33, 40, 55, 66, 77]`.

- **Initial:** `left = 0`, `right = 7`.
- **Step 1:**
    - `mid = (0 + 7) // 2 = 3`. The element at index 3 is `33`.
    - Since `33 < 40`, the target must be in the right half.
    - We update `left = mid + 1 = 4`. The search space is now from index 4 to 7.
- **Step 2:**
    - `mid = (4 + 7) // 2 = 5`. The element at index 5 is `55`.
    - Since `55 > 40`, the target must be in the left half of the current space.
    - We update `right = mid - 1 = 4`. The search space is now just index 4.
- **Step 3:**
    - `mid = (4 + 4) // 2 = 4`. The element at index 4 is `40`.
    - **It's a match!**
- **Result:** The algorithm returns the index `4`.
    

### LeetCode Variant & Solution

This is the most direct application of the algorithm.

- **Problem:** [LeetCode 704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
    
- **Description:** Given a sorted array of integers `nums` and a `target`, find the index of the target. If it does not exist, return -1. Your solution must run in O(logn) time.
    
- **Algorithm Application:** The problem is a textbook case for binary search because the array is sorted and an efficient solution is required.
    

#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def search(nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Performs a binary search to find the target in a sorted list.

    Args:
      nums: A list of integers sorted in ascending order.
      target: The integer to search for.

    Returns:
      The index of the target if found, otherwise -1.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        # Calculate mid-point safely to prevent potential integer overflow
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            # The target must be in the right half
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # The target must be in the left half
            right = mid - 1
    
    # If the loop finishes, the target was not in the list
    return -1

# Example usage:
# nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]
# target = 9
# print(search(nums, target)) # Output: 4
```

#### Code Explanation

1. We set up two pointers: `left` starts at the first index (`0`), and `right` starts at the last index (`len(nums) - 1`).
2. The `while left <= right:` loop ensures we only search while there is a valid interval (i.e., the pointers haven't crossed).
3. Inside the loop, we calculate the `mid` index. The formula `left + (right - left) // 2` is a robust way to prevent errors with very large numbers.
4. We check the element at `nums[mid]`:
    - If it equals `target`, we've found it and return `mid`.
    - If it's less than `target`, we know our target can only be in the right part of the array, so we discard the left half by setting `left = mid + 1`.
    - If it's greater than `target`, we discard the right half by setting `right = mid - 1`.
5. If the while loop ends, it means `left` has become greater than `right`, indicating the target is not in the array, so we return `-1`.

## 3. Bubble Sort 🫧

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. With each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

### Block Diagram (Flow)

```
Start
  |
  v
Outer Loop (for number of passes, n-1 times):
  |
  v
  Inner Loop (from start to the unsorted part of the list):
    |
    v
  Is element[j] > element[j+1]?
    |
    |-- YES -> Swap them
    |
    v NO
  Continue to next adjacent pair
  |
  v
(Inner loop ends)
|
v
(Outer loop ends)
|
v
Return sorted list -> End
```

### Trace for an Example

Let's trace the sorting of the array `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`.

- **Pass 1:**
    - `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]` -> `(5, 1)` are swapped -> `[1, 5, 4, 2, 8]`
    - `[1, 5, 4, 2, 8]` -> `(5, 4)` are swapped -> `[1, 4, 5, 2, 8]`
    - `[1, 4, 5, 2, 8]` -> `(5, 2)` are swapped -> `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
    - `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]` -> `(5, 8)` are not swapped.
    - _Result after Pass 1: `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`. The largest element, 8, is now at the end._
- **Pass 2:** (We only need to check up to the second to last element)
    - `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]` -> `(1, 4)` are not swapped.
    - `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]` -> `(4, 2)` are swapped -> `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
    - `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]` -> `(4, 5)` are not swapped.
    - _Result after Pass 2: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`. The second largest, 5, is in place._
- **Pass 3:**
    - No swaps occur in this pass, as the list is now sorted. An optimized Bubble Sort would stop here.
- **Final Result:** `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`

### LeetCode Variant & Solution

While Bubble Sort is too slow for most LeetCode problems, it can be used to solve simpler ones or as a building block.

- **Problem:** [LeetCode 283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
- **Description:** Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
- **Algorithm Application:** A modified version of the Bubble Sort idea can solve this. We can "bubble" all the non-zero elements to the front of the array. A more common approach uses two pointers, but this demonstrates the adjacent-swapping concept. A single pass of a Bubble Sort-like logic can push all zeroes towards the end.
#### Python Code Solution

Python

```python
def moveZeroes(nums: list[int]) -> None:
    """
    Moves all zeroes to the end of the list in-place, maintaining
    the relative order of non-zero elements.

    Args:
      nums: The list of integers to modify.
    """
    n = len(nums)
    last_non_zero_found_at = 0

    # This isn't a classic Bubble Sort, but uses a similar idea of swapping.
    # We use a pointer (last_non_zero_found_at) to place the next non-zero number.
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            # Swap the current non-zero element with the element at the 
            # 'last_non_zero_found_at' position.
            nums[last_non_zero_found_at], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[last_non_zero_found_at]
            last_non_zero_found_at += 1

# Example usage:
# nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
# moveZeroes(nums)
# print(nums) # Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

#### Code Explanation

1. This approach is a common and efficient way to solve the problem, often called the "two-pointer" method, but it shares the core idea with Bubble Sort of moving elements to their correct partition in the array.
2. We initialize a pointer `last_non_zero_found_at` to `0`. This pointer acts as a marker for the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
3. We iterate through the array with another pointer `i` from beginning to end.
4. When we encounter a non-zero element at `nums[i]`, we swap it with the element at the `last_non_zero_found_at` index.
5. We then increment `last_non_zero_found_at`.
6. This process effectively brings all non-zero elements to the front of the array in their original relative order, and every position after `last_non_zero_found_at` is implicitly filled with zeroes that were swapped back. The function modifies the list in-place and doesn't return anything.
