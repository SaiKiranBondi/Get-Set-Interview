#### Subqueries

A **subquery**, also known as an inner or nested query, is a query that is nested inside another SQL query. The result of the inner query is used by the outer query to help filter the data.

---
##### Example: Finding Employees in a Department (without a JOIN)

Let's find the names of all employees who work in the 'Engineering' department. We can do this by first finding the `DeptID` for 'Engineering' and then using that ID to find the employees.

**Query:**

Using Join
```sql
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM
  Employees AS e
INNER JOIN
  Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
WHERE
  d.DeptName = 'Engineering';
```

Using Subquery

```sql
SELECT
  FirstName,
  LastName
FROM
  Employees
WHERE
  DeptID = (SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE DeptName = 'Engineering');
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+
| FirstName | LastName |
+-----------+----------+
| Alice     | Smith    |
| Charlie   | Brown    |
+-----------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. The database executes the **inner query** first: `(SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE DeptName = 'Engineering')`. This query returns a single value: `1`.
2. The main query then effectively becomes `SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE DeptID = 1;`.
3. This outer query is then executed to produce the final result.

##### Practice Problem & Solution (Subquery)

1. **Problem**: Write a query to find all employees who earn a salary less than the average salary of all employees.
    
    - **Query**:
	```sql
	SELECT
	  FirstName,
	  LastName,
	  Salary
	FROM
	  Employees
	WHERE
	  Salary < (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
	```
    - **Explanation**: The database first calculates the average salary for all employees using the subquery `(SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees)`. The outer query then uses this single value to filter the `Employees` table and return only those employees whose salary is less than that average.

### *Common Table Expressions (CTEs)*

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary, named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. You can think of it as a temporary table that exists only for the duration of a single query.

CTEs are defined using the `WITH` clause and are primarily used to improve the readability and structure of complex queries, breaking them down into logical, step-by-step building blocks.

---

#### Example: Using a CTE to Find Employees in a Department

This solves the same problem as our subquery example, but the logic is often easier to follow.

**Query:**

```sql
WITH EngineeringDept AS (
  SELECT DeptID FROM Departments WHERE DeptName = 'Engineering'
)
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM
  Employees AS e
WHERE
  e.DeptID = (SELECT DeptID FROM EngineeringDept);
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+
| FirstName | LastName |
+-----------+----------+
| Alice     | Smith    |
| Charlie   | Brown    |
+-----------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`WITH EngineeringDept AS (...)`**: This defines a CTE named `EngineeringDept`. The code inside the parentheses is executed, creating a temporary table that contains the `DeptID` for 'Engineering' (which is 1).
2. **`SELECT ...`**: The main query that follows can now use `EngineeringDept` as if it were a real table.
3. The main query selects employees where their `DeptID` matches the `DeptID` from our temporary `EngineeringDept` table.

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (CTE)

1. **Problem**: Using a CTE, find the department(s) with the highest total salary expense.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        WITH DepartmentExpenses AS (
          SELECT
            DeptID,
            SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary
          FROM Employees
          GROUP BY DeptID
        )
        SELECT DeptID, TotalSalary
        FROM DepartmentExpenses
        WHERE TotalSalary = (SELECT MAX(TotalSalary) FROM DepartmentExpenses);
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The CTE `DepartmentExpenses` is created first to calculate the total salary for each department. The main query then selects from this temporary result set, using a subquery to find the maximum total salary and return the corresponding department(s).

### *Window Functions*

A **window function** performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. Unlike a regular aggregate function (like `COUNT()` or `SUM()` with `GROUP BY`), it does not collapse the rows. Instead, it returns a value for **each row** based on a "window" of its neighboring rows.

This is extremely useful for tasks like creating rankings, running totals, or moving averages. The key syntax is the `OVER()` clause.

---

#### Example: Ranking Employees by Salary in Each Department

Imagine you want to rank employees by their salary, but you want the ranking to restart for each department. `GROUP BY` cannot do this, but a window function is perfect for it.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  d.DeptName,
  e.Salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY d.DeptName ORDER BY e.Salary DESC) AS DeptRank
FROM
  Employees AS e
JOIN
  Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+-------------+--------+----------+
| FirstName | DeptName    | Salary | DeptRank |
+-----------+-------------+--------+----------+
| Charlie   | Engineering |  95000 |        1 |
| Alice     | Engineering |  80000 |        2 |
| Ethan     | HR          |  50000 |        1 |
| Diana     | Sales       |  72000 |        1 |
| Bob       | Sales       |  65000 |        2 |
+-----------+-------------+--------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`RANK() OVER (...)`**: This specifies that `RANK()` is being used as a window function.
2. **`PARTITION BY d.DeptName`**: This is like a `GROUP BY` for the window function. It divides the rows into separate "windows" or partitions, one for each department name. The `RANK()` function will be applied independently to each partition.
3. **`ORDER BY e.Salary DESC`**: Within each partition, this sorts the rows by salary from highest to lowest. The `RANK()` function uses this order to assign the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.).

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (Window Function)

1. **Problem**: Using a window function, assign a unique row number to each employee within their department, ordered alphabetically by their first name.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          e.FirstName,
          d.DeptName,
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY d.DeptName ORDER BY e.FirstName) AS RowNum
        FROM
          Employees AS e
        JOIN
          Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a sequential integer to each row. The `PARTITION BY d.DeptName` clause makes this numbering restart for each new department. The `ORDER BY e.FirstName` clause ensures the numbers are assigned in alphabetical order based on the employee's first name within that department.

**Note : This Window Functions dont work on sql 5.7 or below, Try SQL 8**

### *What is an Index?*

An **index** is a special lookup table that the database search engine can use to dramatically speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table.

- **Analogy**: The best way to think of an index is like the **index at the back of a book** ðŸ“–. If you want to find a specific topic, you don't read the entire book from start to finish. Instead, you go to the index, find the topic, and it gives you the exact page numbers to turn to. This is much faster.

---
#### How an Index Improves Performance

- **Without an Index**: When you run a query on a column that is not indexed (e.g., `WHERE FirstName = 'Alice'`), the database must perform a **full table scan**. This means it has to read every single row in the table, one by one, to find the ones that match. For large tables, this is very slow.
- **With an Index**: If you create an index on the `FirstName` column, the database also creates a separate, sorted data structure (usually a **B-Tree**) that acts like a quick lookup table. When you run the same query, the database first searches the small, efficient index to find 'Alice'. The index entry then points directly to the physical location of the corresponding rows in the main table. The database can then jump directly to that location, avoiding a full table scan.

**Diagram: Index vs. Full Table Scan**

#### The Trade-offs of Indexes

Indexes are not free. While they make read operations (`SELECT`) much faster, they **slow down write operations** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). This is because every time you modify the data in a table, the database must also update all the indexes associated with it. Indexes also take up additional disk space.

---

### Basic Query Optimization

Query optimization is the process of writing queries that run as efficiently as possible.

- **Index Wisely**: Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions (foreign keys are excellent candidates for indexes).
- **Avoid `SELECT *`**: Only select the columns you actually need. `SELECT FirstName, LastName` is much more efficient than `SELECT *` because the database has to move less data.
- **Use `EXPLAIN PLAN`**: Most SQL databases have a command like `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN PLAN`. When you put this in front of your query (e.g., `EXPLAIN SELECT ...`), the database won't run the query but will instead show you the **query execution plan**. This plan tells you exactly how the database intends to find the data, including whether it plans to use an index or perform a full table scan. It is the most important tool for debugging a slow query.
