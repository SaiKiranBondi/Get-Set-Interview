### Topic 1: Database Fundamentals

### Setup Code

```sql
-- Create the Departments table
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create the Employees table
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary INT,
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);

-- Insert data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES
(1, 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Sales'),
(3, 'HR');

-- Insert data into Employees
INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DeptID) VALUES
(101, 'Alice', 'Smith', 80000, 1),
(102, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 65000, 2),
(103, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 95000, 1),
(104, 'Diana', 'Prince', 72000, 2),
(105, 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 50000, 3);
```

#### Concept: Keys (Primary & Foreign)

- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column (or a set of columns) that **uniquely identifies** each row in a table. Its value must be unique for each record and cannot be null. In our tables, `DeptID` is the primary key for `Departments`, and `EmpID` is the primary key for `Employees`.
- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column in one table that is used to **create a link** to the primary key of another table. This enforces "relational integrity," meaning you can't have an employee in a department that doesn't exist. In our `Employees` table, `DeptID` is a foreign key that links to the `DeptID` in the `Departments` table.

---
#### Example Query

The `CREATE TABLE` statements you already ran are the perfect example of defining these keys.

SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Salary INT,
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);
```

---

#### Result

Two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`, are created with their respective columns and constraints.

---

#### Explanation

- `PRIMARY KEY`: By adding `PRIMARY KEY` next to `EmpID`, we told the database that no two employees can ever have the same `EmpID`. The database will enforce this rule automatically.
- `FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)`: This line creates the link. It tells the database that the `DeptID` column in the `Employees` table must match an existing `DeptID` in the `Departments` table.

### Practice Problems

1. **Question**: Based on the tables we created, what do you think would happen if you tried to run the following query in DB-Fiddle? Why?
    
    SQL
    
    ```
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DeptID) VALUES (106, 'Frank', 'Castle', 60000, 4);
    ```
    
2. **Question**: Can two employees have the same `FirstName`? Why does the database allow this?
    
---
### Answers

1. **Question**: What would happen if you tried to run `INSERT INTO Employees ... VALUES (..., 4);`?
    
    - **Answer**: The database would return an **error**. This is because of the **foreign key constraint** on the `DeptID` column. The value `4` does not exist in the `Departments` table's `DeptID` column, so the database rejects the `INSERT` statement to maintain data integrity.
        
2. **Question**: Can two employees have the same `FirstName`? Why does the database allow this?
    
    - **Answer**: **Yes**, two employees can have the same `FirstName`. The database allows this because there are no constraints like `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` placed on the `FirstName` column. Only the `EmpID` must be unique.
