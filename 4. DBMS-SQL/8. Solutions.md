## Schema for Reference

![[mermaid-diagram-2025-07-18-173216.png]]

**1. List the full name of all employees hired in the last two years, sorted by the most recent hire.**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, HireDate
FROM Employees
WHERE HireDate >= '2023-07-18'
ORDER BY HireDate DESC;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- **Explanation**: This query filters the `Employees` table to include only those hired on or after today's date two years ago. It then sorts these results in descending order by `HireDate` to show the most recent hires first.

---

**2. Find the first name, last name, and current salary of all employees.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  s.Salary
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01';
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`
    
- **Explanation**: This joins the `Employees` and `Salaries` tables on `EmpID`. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the current salary for each employee, indicated by a `ToDate` far in the future.
    

---

**3. List the names of employees who work in the 'Engineering' or 'Sales' departments.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  d.DeptName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Departments AS d
  ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
WHERE
  d.DeptName IN ('Engineering', 'Sales');
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, `IN`
    
- **Explanation**: This query joins `Employees` and `Departments` and uses the `IN` operator in the `WHERE` clause to efficiently filter for employees who belong to either of the specified departments.
    

---

**4. Find the names of all employees assigned to 'Project Beta'.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN EmployeeProjects AS ep
  ON e.EmpID = ep.EmpID
JOIN Projects AS p
  ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE
  p.ProjectName = 'Project Beta';
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN` (multiple), `WHERE`
    
- **Explanation**: This requires joining three tables: `Employees` to `EmployeeProjects` to find which projects an employee is on, and then to `Projects` to filter by the project's name.
    

---

**5. List the full name of each employee and the name of their manager. Include employees who don't have a manager.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Employee,
  m.FirstName || ' ' || m.LastName AS Manager
FROM Employees AS e
LEFT JOIN Employees AS m
  ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `LEFT JOIN`, `Self Join`
    
- **Explanation**: This query performs a `LEFT JOIN` on the `Employees` table with itself (a self join). This connects an employee row (`e`) to their manager's row (`m`). The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that employees with a `NULL` `ManagerID` (who have no manager) are still included in the result.
    

---

**6. How many employees work on 'Project Alpha'?**

SQL

```
SELECT
  COUNT(ep.EmpID) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM EmployeeProjects AS ep
JOIN Projects AS p
  ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE
  p.ProjectName = 'Project Alpha';
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `COUNT`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`
    
- **Explanation**: This query joins the linking table with the `Projects` table to find the project by name, then uses the `COUNT` aggregate function to count the number of employee entries for that project.
    

---

**7. What is the average current salary for the 'Engineering' department?**

SQL

```
SELECT
  AVG(s.Salary) AS AvgEngineeringSalary
FROM Salaries AS s
JOIN Employees AS e
  ON s.EmpID = e.EmpID
JOIN Departments AS d
  ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01' AND d.DeptName = 'Engineering';
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `AVG`, `INNER JOIN` (multiple), `WHERE`
    
- **Explanation**: This joins all three tables, filters for employees in the 'Engineering' department with a current salary, and then uses the `AVG` function to calculate the average.
    

---

**8. List the departments that have more than two employees.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  d.DeptName
FROM Departments AS d
JOIN Employees AS e
  ON d.DeptID = e.DeptID
GROUP BY
  d.DeptName
HAVING
  COUNT(e.EmpID) > 2;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`
    
- **Explanation**: The query groups employees by their department name, counts the employees in each group, and then the `HAVING` clause filters these groups to show only those with more than two members.
    

---

**9. Find the names of employees who are not assigned to any projects.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeProjects AS ep
  ON e.EmpID = ep.EmpID
WHERE
  ep.ProjectID IS NULL;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `LEFT JOIN`, `WHERE`, `IS NULL`
    
- **Explanation**: This uses a `LEFT JOIN` to list all employees and their projects. For employees with no projects, the columns from `EmployeeProjects` will be `NULL`. The `WHERE` clause filters to find only these `NULL` instances.
    

---

**10. List the projects that have no employees assigned to them.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  p.ProjectName
FROM Projects AS p
LEFT JOIN EmployeeProjects AS ep
  ON p.ProjectID = ep.ProjectID
WHERE
  ep.EmpID IS NULL;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `LEFT JOIN`, `WHERE`, `IS NULL`
    
- **Explanation**: This uses the same pattern as the previous question but starts with `Projects` as the left table to find projects that have no matching entry in the `EmployeeProjects` table.
    

---

**11. Find the employee with the highest current salary.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01'
ORDER BY
  s.Salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
    
- **Explanation**: This query finds all current salaries, sorts them in descending order to put the highest first, and then uses `LIMIT 1` to return only that top row.
    

---

**12. For each department, find the employee who was hired most recently.**

SQL

```
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
  SELECT
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    d.DeptName,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY d.DeptID ORDER BY e.HireDate DESC) as rn
  FROM Employees AS e
  JOIN Departments AS d
    ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
)
SELECT
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  DeptName
FROM RankedEmployees
WHERE
  rn = 1;
```

- **Topics used**: CTE, Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`), `PARTITION BY`, `INNER JOIN`
    
- **Explanation**: A CTE and the `ROW_NUMBER` window function are used to rank employees within each department based on their hire date. The outer query then simply selects the employee with rank #1 from each department.
    

---

**13. List all employees who have the same manager as 'Bob Johnson'.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  FirstName,
  LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE
  ManagerID = (
    SELECT ManagerID FROM Employees WHERE FirstName = 'Bob' AND LastName = 'Johnson'
  ) AND EmpID != 102;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, Subquery
    
- **Explanation**: A subquery first finds the `ManagerID` for 'Bob Johnson'. The outer query then finds all other employees who share that same `ManagerID`, making sure to exclude Bob himself.
    

---

**14. Find the names of employees whose current salary is greater than the average current salary across all employees.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01' AND s.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Salaries WHERE ToDate = '9999-01-01'
  );
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, Subquery, `AVG`
    
- **Explanation**: A subquery first calculates the single average value of all current salaries. The outer query then compares each employee's current salary against this value and returns those who are higher.
    

---

**15. Find the project with the highest number of assigned employees.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  p.ProjectName
FROM Projects AS p
JOIN EmployeeProjects AS ep
  ON p.ProjectID = ep.ProjectID
GROUP BY
  p.ProjectName
ORDER BY
  COUNT(ep.EmpID) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `COUNT`
    
- **Explanation**: The query groups by project name, counts the employees in each group, sorts the groups by that count in descending order, and returns the top one.
    

---

**16. List the employees who have received more than one salary raise.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
GROUP BY
  e.EmpID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
HAVING
  COUNT(s.FromDate) > 1;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`
    
- **Explanation**: This query groups the salary history by employee and uses the `HAVING` clause to find employees who have more than one salary record, which indicates they have received at least one raise.
    

---

**17. Find the department with the highest average current salary.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  d.DeptName
FROM Departments AS d
JOIN Employees AS e
  ON d.DeptID = e.DeptID
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01'
GROUP BY
  d.DeptName
ORDER BY
  AVG(s.Salary) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT`, `INNER JOIN` (multiple), `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `AVG`
    
- **Explanation**: This calculates the average current salary for each department, sorts the departments based on this average in descending order, and selects the top one.
    

---

**18. Rank employees in each department based on their current salary, from highest to lowest.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  d.DeptName,
  s.Salary,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.DeptName ORDER BY s.Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
JOIN Departments AS d
  ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01';
```

- **Topics used**: Window Functions (`RANK`), `PARTITION BY`, `INNER JOIN`
    
- **Explanation**: The `RANK` window function assigns a salary rank to each employee. The `PARTITION BY d.DeptName` clause makes the ranking restart for each department.
    

---

**19. Find the second highest current salary among all employees.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  MAX(Salary)
FROM Salaries
WHERE
  ToDate = '9999-01-01' AND Salary < (
    SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Salaries WHERE ToDate = '9999-01-01'
  );
```

- **Topics used**: Subquery, `MAX`, `WHERE`
    
- **Explanation**: The subquery finds the absolute highest salary. The outer query then finds the highest salary that is still less than that absolute maximum, which gives the second highest salary.
    

---

**20. For each employee, show their full name, current salary, and the average salary of their department.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  s.Salary,
  AVG(s.Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY e.DeptID) AS DeptAverageSalary
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01';
```

- **Topics used**: Window Functions (`AVG`), `PARTITION BY`, `INNER JOIN`
    
- **Explanation**: This uses `AVG` as a window function. The `PARTITION BY` clause creates a "window" of employees in the same department, and the function calculates the average salary for that window, displaying it on each row.
    

---

**21. Find the employees who are managers.**

SQL

```
SELECT DISTINCT
  m.FirstName,
  m.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Employees AS m
  ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID;
```

- **Topics used**: `SELECT DISTINCT`, `INNER JOIN`, `Self Join`
    
- **Explanation**: This query performs a self join on the `Employees` table, matching `ManagerID` to `EmpID`. `SELECT DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each manager is only listed once, even if they manage multiple people.
    

---

**22. Calculate the running total of salaries for employees ordered by their hire date.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.HireDate,
  s.Salary,
  SUM(s.Salary) OVER(ORDER BY e.HireDate) AS RunningTotalSalary
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Salaries AS s
  ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
WHERE
  s.ToDate = '9999-01-01';
```

- **Topics used**: Window Functions (`SUM`), `ORDER BY` (inside OVER), `INNER JOIN`
    
- **Explanation**: This uses `SUM` as a window function. The `ORDER BY e.HireDate` clause inside `OVER()` defines the window as the current row and all previous rows based on hire date, creating a cumulative sum.
    

---

**23. Find the employees who work on both 'Project Alpha' and 'Project Beta'.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN EmployeeProjects AS ep
  ON e.EmpID = ep.EmpID
JOIN Projects AS p
  ON ep.ProjectID = p.ProjectID
WHERE
  p.ProjectName IN ('Project Alpha', 'Project Beta')
GROUP BY
  e.EmpID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
HAVING
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProjectName) = 2;
```

- **Topics used**: `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE`, `IN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`
    
- **Explanation**: This query first finds all employee-project assignments for the two specified projects. It then groups by employee and uses `HAVING COUNT(...) = 2` to ensure that only employees associated with both projects are returned.
    

---

**24. List the managers and the number of employees who report directly to them.**

SQL

```
SELECT
  m.FirstName,
  m.LastName,
  COUNT(e.EmpID) AS NumberOfReports
FROM Employees AS e
JOIN Employees AS m
  ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID
GROUP BY
  m.EmpID, m.FirstName, m.LastName;
```

- **Topics used**: `Self Join`, `INNER JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`
    
- **Explanation**: The self join links employees to their managers. The query then groups by the manager and uses `COUNT` to find the number of employees in each manager's group.
    

---

**25. Find the top two highest-paid employees within each department.**

SQL

```
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
  SELECT
    e.FirstName,
    d.DeptName,
    s.Salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY d.DeptName ORDER BY s.Salary DESC) as rn
  FROM Employees AS e
  JOIN Salaries AS s
    ON e.EmpID = s.EmpID
  JOIN Departments AS d
    ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
  WHERE
    s.ToDate = '9999-01-01'
)
SELECT
  FirstName,
  DeptName,
  Salary
FROM RankedEmployees
WHERE
  rn <= 2;
```

- **Topics used**: CTE, Window Functions (`ROW_NUMBER`), `PARTITION BY`, `INNER JOIN`
    
- **Explanation**: A CTE is used to first rank employees within each department by their current salary using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function. The outer query then filters this ranked set to select only those employees with a rank of 1 or 2.

## 15 Common DBMS Questions (Solutions)

### Database Design & Normalization

1. What is normalization and why is it important?

Normalization is the process of organizing tables in a database to minimize data redundancy (repetition) and improve data integrity. It's important because it prevents data anomalies like insertion, deletion, and update errors.

---

**2. Can you explain the difference between 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF in simple terms?**

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures that every cell in a table holds a single, atomic value. There are no repeating groups.
    
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: The table must be in 1NF, and all non-key columns must depend on the _entire_ primary key (this applies to tables with composite primary keys).
    
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: The table must be in 2NF, and no non-key column should depend on another non-key column (no transitive dependencies).
    

---

3. What is denormalization and when would you use it?

Denormalization is the process of intentionally violating normalization rules by adding redundant data to a table. It's used to improve read performance in situations where joins are too slow, such as in data warehousing or high-traffic applications.

---

**4. What is the difference between a Primary Key, a Foreign Key, and a Unique Key?**

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a row, cannot be NULL, and there can only be one per table.
    
- **Foreign Key**: Links a row in one table to the primary key of another table, enforcing relational integrity.
    
- **Unique Key**: Ensures all values in a column are unique. It can accept one NULL value, and a table can have multiple unique keys.
    

### Transactions & Concurrency

5. What are the ACID properties of a transaction? Can you explain each one?

ACID properties guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

- **Atomicity**: The "all or nothing" rule. A transaction either completes entirely, or none of its changes are saved.
    
- **Consistency**: A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, ensuring all rules and constraints are followed.
    
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not affect each other. It's as if they are executed one after another.
    
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive any subsequent system failure.
    

---

6. What is a deadlock and how can it be prevented?

A deadlock is a situation where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, causing all of them to be stuck. It can be prevented by setting transaction timeouts or by ensuring that all transactions lock resources in a consistent, predetermined order.

---

**7. Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control.**

- **Pessimistic**: Assumes conflicts are likely. It **locks** resources as soon as they are accessed to prevent other transactions from modifying them.
    
- **Optimistic**: Assumes conflicts are rare. It **does not lock** resources. Instead, it checks for conflicts at the commit stage. If a conflict is found, one transaction is rolled back.
    

### Indexing & Performance

8. What is an index and how does it improve query performance?

An index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of data in a table. It improves performance by allowing the database to find a row directly without having to perform a full table scan (reading every row). It's like using the index at the back of a book instead of reading the entire book to find a topic.

---

**9. What are the disadvantages of having too many indexes on a table?**

- They **slow down write operations** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) because every index must also be updated.
    
- They consume extra **storage space** on the disk.
    

---

**10. What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?**

- **Clustered Index**: Determines the **physical order** of data in a table. A table can only have one clustered index. Think of a dictionary, where the words are physically sorted.
    
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Creates a separate lookup structure that points back to the data rows, which are stored in a different order. A table can have many non-clustered indexes. Think of the index at the back of a book.
    

### General Concepts

**11. What is the difference between a DBMS and an RDBMS?**

- **DBMS (Database Management System)** is the generic term for software that manages databases.
    
- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is a specific _type_ of DBMS that is based on the relational model, where data is stored in tables. Most modern databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are RDBMSs.
    

---

**12. Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.**

- **SQL Databases**: Are relational (RDBMS), use structured query language (SQL), have a predefined schema, and are vertically scalable.
    
- **NoSQL Databases**: Are non-relational, have dynamic schemas for unstructured data (document, key-value, graph), and are horizontally scalable.
    

---

13. What is the CAP theorem?

The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system can only simultaneously provide two of the following three guarantees:

- **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write.
    
- **Availability**: Every request receives a non-error response.
    
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions (lost messages between nodes).
    

---

**14. What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP` commands?**

- **`DELETE`**: A DML command that removes rows one by one. It's slower and can be rolled back.
    
- **`TRUNCATE`**: A DDL command that removes all rows from a table at once. It's faster and cannot be rolled back.
    
- **`DROP`**: A DDL command that completely removes the entire table structure and all its data.
    

---

15. What is database sharding?

Sharding is a method of horizontal scaling where a large database is partitioned into smaller, faster, and more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate database server, distributing the load.

---
