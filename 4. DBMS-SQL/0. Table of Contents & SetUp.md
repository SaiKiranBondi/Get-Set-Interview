### DBMS and SQL Topics

**1. Database Fundamentals**

- What is a Database?
- DBMS vs. RDBMS
- Keys (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key)
- SQL (Structured Query Language) Overview

**2. Core SQL Queries**

- `SELECT` and `FROM`: Retrieving data
- `WHERE`: Filtering results
- `ORDER BY`: Sorting results
- `GROUP BY`: Aggregating data
- `HAVING`: Filtering aggregated data

**3. Joining Tables**

- Understanding Joins
- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN` (and `RIGHT JOIN`)
- `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- Self Join

**4. Data Manipulation (DML) & Definition (DDL)**

- **DML**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **DDL**: `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`
- Constraints (NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT)

**5. Database Design & Normalization**

- What is Normalization?
- First Normal Form (1NF)
- Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Third Normal Form (3NF)

**6. Advanced SQL & Optimization**

- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions
- What is an Index? How does it improve performance?
- Basic Query Optimization

## **Setup**
### Online SQL Platform

For hands-on practice, I recommend using **DB-Fiddle**.

- **Website**: [https://www.db-fiddle.com/](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)
- **Why it's good**: It's a free, web-based tool that requires no installation. You can choose different database systems (like MySQL, PostgreSQL), write your table creation code in one panel, your queries in another, and see the results instantly. It's perfect for trying out the examples we'll cover.

### Sample Tables for Our Lessons

To learn, we need data to work with. For all our examples, we will use two simple tables: `Employees` and `Departments`.

**Action**: Please copy and paste the code below into the **left-hand "Schema" panel** on DB-Fiddle and click the **"Run"** button. This will create our sample database for all the following topics.

You need to separate the table creation statements from the query statements in SQL Fiddle. It has two main panels for this reason.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Left Panel (Build Schema):** Copy all of your `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements into this panel. This part sets up the database structure and data.
    
    ```sql
    -- Create the Departments table
    CREATE TABLE Departments (
        DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        DeptName VARCHAR(50)
    );
    
    -- Create the Employees table
    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        FirstName VARCHAR(50),
        LastName VARCHAR(50),
        Salary INT,
        DeptID INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
    );
    
    -- Insert data into Departments
    INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES
    (1, 'Engineering'),
    (2, 'Sales'),
    (3, 'HR');
    
    -- Insert data into Employees
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DeptID) VALUES
    (101, 'Alice', 'Smith', 80000, 1),
    (102, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 65000, 2),
    (103, 'Charlie', 'Brown', 95000, 1),
    (104, 'Diana', 'Prince', 72000, 2),
    (105, 'Ethan', 'Hunt', 50000, 3);
    ```
    
2. **Right Panel (Run SQL):** Copy only your `SELECT` query into this panel. This is for running queries against the schema you built.

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM Employees;
    ```
    
3. **Run the Code**:
    
    - First, click the **Build Schema** button on the left.
    - After it finishes, click the **Run SQL** button on the right.

The output will then appear in the results section at the bottom.
