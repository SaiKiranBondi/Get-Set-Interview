These are the two main categories of SQL commands. DML is for working with the data _inside_ the tables, while DDL is for managing the table structure _itself_.

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML commands are used to add, modify, and remove data from a database.

---

#### `INSERT`

**Concept**: Adds a new row of data to a table.

**Query:**
```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName)
VALUES (5, 'Finance');
```

**Result**: A new row is added to the `Departments` table. If you run `SELECT * FROM Departments;`, you will now see the Finance department.

---

#### `UPDATE`

**Concept**: Modifies existing records in a table. The `WHERE` clause is crucial here to specify which row(s) to update.

**Query:**

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 70000
WHERE EmpID = 102;
```

**Result**: The salary for the employee with `EmpID` 102 (Bob Johnson) is changed to 70000.

---

#### `DELETE`

**Concept**: Removes existing records from a table. The `WHERE` clause is critical to avoid deleting all rows.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmpID = 105;
```

**Result**: The row for the employee with `EmpID` 105 (Ethan Hunt) is permanently removed from the table.

---

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL commands are used to define and manage the database structure.

- **`CREATE TABLE`**: Creates a new table in the database. (We've already used this).
- **`ALTER TABLE`**: Modifies an existing table, such as adding or removing a column. (We used this to add the `ManagerID` column).
- **`DROP TABLE`**: Deletes an entire table and all its data permanently.

### Practice Problems & Solutions (DML)

1. **INSERT Problem**: Write a query to add a new employee, 'Frank West', with `EmpID` 107 and a salary of 58000 to the 'Sales' department (`DeptID` = 2).
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DeptID)
        VALUES (107, 'Frank', 'West', 58000, 2);
        ```
    - **Explanation**: This uses `INSERT` to add a new row to the `Employees` table, specifying the values for each column in the correct order.
    
2. **UPDATE Problem**: Diana Prince (`EmpID` = 104) got a raise. Write a query to increase her salary to 75000.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        UPDATE Employees
        SET Salary = 75000
        WHERE EmpID = 104;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `UPDATE` statement targets the `Employees` table, the `SET` clause specifies the new value for the `Salary` column, and the `WHERE` clause ensures that only the row for `EmpID` 104 is changed.
        
3. **DELETE Problem**: Write a query to remove the new employee 'Frank West' (`EmpID` = 107) from the database.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        DELETE FROM Employees
        WHERE EmpID = 107;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `DELETE` statement removes rows from the `Employees` table. The `WHERE` clause is used to specify that only the row for the employee with `EmpID` 107 should be deleted.
