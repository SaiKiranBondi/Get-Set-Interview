### What is Normalization?

**Normalization** is the process of organizing the columns and tables in a relational database to minimize **data redundancy** (repetition) and improve **data integrity**. The goal is to ensure that data is stored logically and that dependencies between data are enforced.

Without normalization, databases can suffer from "data anomalies":

- **Insertion Anomaly**: You can't add a new piece of data because another piece of data is missing.
- **Deletion Anomaly**: Deleting one piece of data unintentionally removes another unrelated piece of data.
- **Update Anomaly**: To update a single piece of data, you have to change it in multiple places, which can lead to inconsistencies.

Normalization involves following a set of rules called **Normal Forms**. We'll cover the first three, which are the most important.

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

**Rule**: A table is in 1NF if all its columns contain **atomic** (indivisible) values, and each row is unique.

"Before" (Not in 1NF):

Imagine a table where multiple phone numbers are stored in a single column.

```
+-------+--------------------------+
| EmpID | PhoneNumbers             |
+-------+--------------------------+
|   101 | "555-1234, 555-5678"     |
+-------+--------------------------+
```

This violates 1NF because the `PhoneNumbers` column is not atomic.

"After" (In 1NF):

To fix this, we create a separate table for phone numbers, ensuring each cell has only one value.

```
// Employees Table
+-------+-----------+
| EmpID | FirstName |
+-------+-----------+
|   101 | Alice     |
+-------+-----------+

// EmployeePhoneNumbers Table
+-------+------------+
| EmpID | PhoneNumber|
+-------+------------+
|   101 | "555-1234" |
|   101 | "555-5678" |
+-------+------------+
```

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

**Rule**: The table must be in 1NF, and all non-key columns must be fully dependent on the **entire primary key**. (This rule is only relevant for tables with a **composite primary key**—a key made of two or more columns).

"Before" (Not in 2NF):

Consider a table with a composite key of (OrderID, ProductID).

```
+---------+-----------+-------------+----------+-----------+
| OrderID | ProductID | ProductName | Quantity | OrderDate |
+---------+-----------+-------------+----------+-----------+
|       1 |       101 | 'Keyboard'  |        2 |'2025-07-18'|
+---------+-----------+-------------+----------+-----------+
```

Here, `ProductName` depends only on `ProductID`, not the full key. `OrderDate` depends only on `OrderID`. This is a partial dependency.

"After" (In 2NF):

We split the table to remove partial dependencies.

```
// Orders Table
+---------+-----------+
| OrderID | OrderDate |
+---------+-----------+
|       1 |'2025-07-18'|
+---------+-----------+

// Products Table
+-----------+-------------+
| ProductID | ProductName |
+-----------+-------------+
|       101 | 'Keyboard'  |
+-----------+-------------+

// OrderDetails Table
+---------+-----------+----------+
| OrderID | ProductID | Quantity |
+---------+-----------+----------+
|       1 |       101 |        2 |
+---------+-----------+----------+
```

---

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

**Rule**: The table must be in 2NF, and there should be no **transitive dependencies**. A transitive dependency is when a non-key column depends on another non-key column.

"Before" (Not in 3NF):

Imagine if we had stored the DeptName directly in the Employees table.

```
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+
| EmpID | FirstName | DeptID | DeptName    |
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+
|   101 | Alice     |      1 | Engineering |
+-------+-----------+--------+-------------+
```

Here, `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, which is a non-key column. The chain is `EmpID` → `DeptID` → `DeptName`.

"After" (In 3NF):

We remove the transitive dependency by splitting the table. This is the exact structure we have been using all along!

```
// Employees Table
+-------+-----------+--------+
| EmpID | FirstName | DeptID |
+-------+-----------+--------+
|   101 | Alice     |      1 |
+-------+-----------+--------+

// Departments Table
+--------+-------------+
| DeptID | DeptName    |
+--------+-------------+
|      1 | Engineering |
+--------+-------------+
```

Our original database design was already in 3NF, which is the goal for most relational databases.
