#### Concept: Understanding Joins

A **`JOIN`** clause is used to **combine rows from two or more tables** based on a related column between them. This is the most powerful feature of relational databases, as it allows us to link related data that is stored in separate tables.

For example, our `Employees` table has a `DeptID`, but not the department name. The `Departments` table has the name. To get a list of employees and their department names in a single query, we need to join them.

---

### `INNER JOIN`

#### Concept

An **`INNER JOIN`** returns only the rows where the join condition is met in **both tables**. It finds the matching records between two tables.

**Analogy**: Think of a Venn diagram. An `INNER JOIN` returns only the overlapping, intersectional area.

---
#### Example: Listing Employees and their Department Names

This query combines the `Employees` and `Departments` tables to show each employee's name alongside their department's name.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  d.DeptName
FROM
  Employees AS e
INNER JOIN
  Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+-------------+
| FirstName | LastName | DeptName    |
+-----------+----------+-------------+
| Alice     | Smith    | Engineering |
| Bob       | Johnson  | Sales       |
| Charlie   | Brown    | Engineering |
| Diana     | Prince   | Sales       |
| Ethan     | Hunt     | HR          |
+-----------+----------+-------------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`Employees AS e`**: We use an alias `e` to refer to the `Employees` table to keep the query short. Similarly, `d` for `Departments`.
2. **`INNER JOIN`**: This tells the database to combine rows from both tables.
3. **`ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID`**: This is the crucial **join condition**. It tells the database how to match the rows. For each row in `Employees`, it looks for a row in `Departments` where the `DeptID` is the same.
4. If a match is found, it combines the columns specified in the `SELECT` list into a single result row.

### Practice Problem & Solution (`INNER JOIN`)

1. **Problem**: Write a query to find the first name, last name, and salary of all employees who work in the 'Sales' department.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          e.FirstName,
          e.LastName,
          e.Salary
        FROM
          Employees AS e
        INNER JOIN
          Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID
        WHERE
          d.DeptName = 'Sales';
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `INNER JOIN` first creates a temporary combined table of employees and their department names. The `WHERE` clause then filters this combined result to show only the rows where the department name is 'Sales'.
---
### `LEFT JOIN` (and `RIGHT JOIN`)

#### Concept

A **`LEFT JOIN`** returns **all** records from the **left table** (the first table mentioned in the query) and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match for a record from the left table, the result for the right table's columns will be `NULL`.

**Analogy**: In a Venn diagram, a `LEFT JOIN` returns everything in the left circle, plus the overlapping intersection.

---
#### Example: Listing All Departments and Their Employees

To properly see how this works, let's add a department that has no employees.

**Action**: Run this query in your DB-Fiddle to add the 'Marketing' department.

```sql
INSERT INTO Departments (DeptID, DeptName) VALUES (4, 'Marketing');
```

Now, let's run a `LEFT JOIN` to list all departments, even those without employees.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  d.DeptName,
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName
FROM
  Departments AS d
LEFT JOIN
  Employees AS e ON d.DeptID = e.DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+-------------+-----------+----------+
| DeptName    | FirstName | LastName |
+-------------+-----------+----------+
| Engineering | Alice     | Smith    |
| Engineering | Charlie   | Brown    |
| Sales       | Bob       | Johnson  |
| Sales       | Diana     | Prince   |
| HR          | Ethan     | Hunt     |
| Marketing   | NULL      | NULL     |
+-------------+-----------+----------+
```

Explanation:

The query starts with Departments as the left table, so it includes every department. For 'Engineering', 'Sales', and 'HR', it finds matching employees and lists them. For the 'Marketing' department, it finds no matching DeptID in the Employees table. Instead of discarding the row (like an INNER JOIN would), it keeps the 'Marketing' row and fills the columns from the Employees table with NULL.

**A Note on `RIGHT JOIN`**: A `RIGHT JOIN` does the exact opposite: it returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left. It's less common because you can almost always get the same result by swapping the table order and using a `LEFT JOIN`.

---

### Practice Problems & Solutions (`LEFT JOIN`)

**Setup**: First, let's add an employee who is not yet assigned to a department. Run this query in your DB-Fiddle.

SQL

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmpID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DeptID) VALUES (106, 'Grace', 'Hopper', 120000, NULL);
```

1. **Problem**: Write a query to list all employees and their department name. If an employee is not assigned to a department, they should still appear in the list.
    
    - **Query**:        
        ```sql
        SELECT
          e.FirstName,
          e.LastName,
          d.DeptName
        FROM
          Employees AS e
        LEFT JOIN
          Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: Because `Employees` is the left table, all employees are included in the result. For Grace Hopper, her `DeptID` is `NULL`, so the join condition fails, and the `DeptName` is shown as `NULL`.
        
2. **Problem**: Using a `LEFT JOIN`, find the names of all departments that have no employees.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          d.DeptName
        FROM
          Departments AS d
        LEFT JOIN
          Employees AS e ON d.DeptID = e.DeptID
        WHERE
          e.EmpID IS NULL;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: This is a common pattern. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures all departments are listed. For any department that has no employees, all the columns from the `Employees` table (`e`) will be `NULL`. The `WHERE e.EmpID IS NULL` clause then filters the results to show only those rows.

---
### `FULL OUTER JOIN`
#### Concept

A **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** combines the results of both a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`. It returns **all** records from **both tables**. If a record in one table does not have a match in the other, the query will still return that record and fill the columns from the other table with `NULL`.

**Analogy**: In a Venn diagram, a `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns the entire union of both circles.

![[Pasted image 20250718021715.png]]

---
#### Example: Listing All Employees and All Departments

Using the data we set up in the previous step (which includes an employee with no department and a department with no employees), this join shows everything.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  e.FirstName,
  e.LastName,
  d.DeptName
FROM
  Employees AS e
FULL OUTER JOIN
  Departments AS d ON e.DeptID = d.DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+-------------+
| FirstName | LastName | DeptName    |
+-----------+----------+-------------+
| Alice     | Smith    | Engineering |
| Bob       | Johnson  | Sales       |
| Charlie   | Brown    | Engineering |
| Diana     | Prince   | Sales       |
| Ethan     | Hunt     | HR          |
| Grace     | Hopper   | NULL        |
| NULL      | NULL     | Marketing   |
+-----------+----------+-------------+
```

Explanation:

This result gives us a complete picture:

- The matched employees and their departments.
- The employee 'Grace Hopper' who has no department (`DeptName` is `NULL`). 
- The 'Marketing' department which has no employees (`FirstName` and `LastName` are `NULL`).

**Note on Database Support**: Some databases like MySQL don't support `FULL OUTER JOIN`. You can achieve the same result by combining a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN` with a `UNION` clause.

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (`FULL OUTER JOIN`)

1. **Problem**: Describe a business scenario where a `FULL OUTER JOIN` would be useful. For example, think about a table of `Salespeople` and a table of `ProductSales`.
    - **Explanation**: A `FULL OUTER JOIN` between `Salespeople` and `ProductSales` would be very useful for a sales manager. The result would show:
        1. Salespeople who made sales (the matched records).
        2. Salespeople who did _not_ make any sales (where `ProductSales` columns would be `NULL`).
        3. Any sales that were recorded without being assigned to a specific salesperson (where Salespeople columns would be NULL).
     This gives a complete view of performance and potential data entry errors.
---

### `Self Join`

#### Concept

A **`Self Join`** is not a different type of join; it is a regular join (`INNER`, `LEFT`, etc.) where a table is joined **with itself**. This is useful for querying hierarchical data or comparing rows within the same table.

The most common use case is an "employees and managers" scenario, where a `ManagerID` column in the `Employees` table refers to another `EmpID` in the same table.

---

#### Example: Listing Employees and their Managers

To see this in action, we need to add a `ManagerID` to our `Employees` table.

**Action**: Run these queries in your DB-Fiddle to update the table structure and data.

SQL

```sql
-- Add a ManagerID column to the Employees table
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD COLUMN ManagerID INT;

-- Assign managers to the employees
UPDATE Employees SET ManagerID = 103 WHERE EmpID IN (101, 105);
UPDATE Employees SET ManagerID = 101 WHERE EmpID IN (102, 104);
```

_In this setup, Charlie (103) manages Alice and Ethan. Alice (101) manages Bob and Diana._

Now, let's write a query to list each employee and their manager's name.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  e.FirstName AS EmployeeName,
  m.FirstName AS ManagerName
FROM
  Employees AS e
INNER JOIN
  Employees AS m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID;
```

**Result:**

```
+--------------+-------------+
| EmployeeName | ManagerName |
+--------------+-------------+
| Alice        | Charlie     |
| Ethan        | Charlie     |
| Bob          | Alice       |
| Diana        | Alice       |
+--------------+-------------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Employees AS m`**: We list the `Employees` table twice, giving it two different aliases. Think of `e` as the "employee" role and `m` as the "manager" role.
2. **`ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID`**: This is the join condition. It matches the `ManagerID` from the "employee" instance of the table (`e`) to the `EmpID` from the "manager" instance of the table (`m`).
3. For example, for Bob (`e.EmpID`=102), his `e.ManagerID` is 101. The query finds the row in the "manager" instance (`m`) where `m.EmpID` is 101, which is Alice. It then combines their names for the result.

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (`Self Join`)

1. **Problem**: Write a query to list **all** employees and their manager's name. If an employee does not have a manager, they should still be in the list.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          e.FirstName AS EmployeeName,
          m.FirstName AS ManagerName
        FROM
          Employees AS e
        LEFT JOIN
          Employees AS m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmpID;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: By using a `LEFT JOIN` instead of an `INNER JOIN`, we ensure that every record from the "employee" table (`e`) is included, even if its `ManagerID` is `NULL` and doesn't find a match in the "manager" table (`m`). This will show employees like Charlie and Grace, who have no manager, with `NULL` in the `ManagerName` column.
---
### The `UNION` Operator

The **`UNION`** operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows from the final result.

There are two main rules for `UNION`:

1. Every `SELECT` statement within the `UNION` must have the **same number of columns**.
2. The columns must also have **similar data types**.

---

#### Example: Combining Two Lists

Imagine we have another table called `ProspectiveEmployees` with a similar structure.

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT ProspectName, ProspectLastName FROM ProspectiveEmployees;
```

Explanation:

This query would take all the first and last names from the Employees table and all the names from the ProspectiveEmployees table and display them as a single combined list. If an employee "John Smith" existed in both tables, he would only appear once in the result because UNION automatically removes duplicates.

**`UNION ALL`**: If you want to keep all duplicate records, you can use `UNION ALL` instead.
Thank you again for catching that.
