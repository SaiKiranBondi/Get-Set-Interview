Excellent. I'm glad that format works. I will use it for all future examples.

Let's restart **Topic 2** from the beginning, covering everything up to the `WHERE` clause.

### Topic 2: Core SQL Queries

### `SELECT` and `FROM`

#### Concept

- **`SELECT`**: This clause specifies the **columns** you want to retrieve.
- **`FROM`**: This clause specifies the **table** from which to retrieve the data.

#### Example 1: Selecting All Columns

This query retrieves every column for every row from the `Employees` table.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees;
```

**Result:**

```
+-------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
| EmpID | FirstName | LastName | Salary | DeptID |
+-------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
|   101 | Alice     | Smith    |  80000 |      1 |
|   102 | Bob       | Johnson  |  65000 |      2 |
|   103 | Charlie   | Brown    |  95000 |      1 |
|   104 | Diana     | Prince   |  72000 |      2 |
|   105 | Ethan     | Hunt     |  50000 |      3 |
+-------+-----------+----------+--------+--------+
```

#### Example 2: Selecting Specific Columns

This query retrieves only the first name, last name, and salary for every employee.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+--------+
| FirstName | LastName | Salary |
+-----------+----------+--------+
| Alice     | Smith    |  80000 |
| Bob       | Johnson  |  65000 |
| Charlie   | Brown    |  95000 |
| Diana     | Prince   |  72000 |
| Ethan     | Hunt     |  50000 |
+-----------+----------+--------+
```

#### Practice Problems (`SELECT` and `FROM`)

1. **Simple**: Write a query to get a list of all department names from the `Departments` table.
2. **Intermediate**: Write a query to show the last name and the department ID for all employees.

---
### The `WHERE` Clause

#### Concept

The **`WHERE`** clause is used to **filter records**. It extracts only those rows that fulfill a specified condition.

#### Example 1: Simple Filter

This query finds all employees who work in the Engineering department (`DeptID` = 1).

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, DeptID
FROM Employees
WHERE DeptID = 1;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+--------+
| FirstName | LastName | DeptID |
+-----------+----------+--------+
| Alice     | Smith    |      1 |
| Charlie   | Brown    |      1 |
+-----------+----------+--------+
```

#### Example 2: Using `AND`

This query finds employees in the Engineering department (`DeptID` = 1) who also have a salary greater than 80000.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE DeptID = 1 AND Salary > 80000;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+--------+
| FirstName | LastName | Salary |
+-----------+----------+--------+
| Charlie   | Brown    |  95000 |
+-----------+----------+--------+
```

#### Practice Problems (`WHERE`)

1. **Simple**: Write a query to find the first and last name of the employee with `EmpID` 104.
2. **Intermediate**: Write a query to list the full names (`FirstName`, `LastName`) of all employees who have a salary less than 70000.
3. **Complex**: Write a query to find the `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Salary` of all employees who are in the Sales department (`DeptID` = 2) **or** have a salary greater than 90000.

---
### The `ORDER BY` Clause

#### Concept

The **`ORDER BY`** clause is used to **sort** the rows in your result set based on a specific column. By default, it sorts in ascending order.

- **`ASC`**: Sorts in ascending order (A to Z, 0 to 9). This is the default.
- **`DESC`**: Sorts in descending order (Z to A, 9 to 0).

---

#### Example 1: Sorting in Ascending Order

This query retrieves all employees and sorts them alphabetically by their first name.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY FirstName ASC;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+--------+
| FirstName | LastName | Salary |
+-----------+----------+--------+
| Alice     | Smith    |  80000 |
| Bob       | Johnson  |  65000 |
| Charlie   | Brown    |  95000 |
| Diana     | Prince   |  72000 |
| Ethan     | Hunt     |  50000 |
+-----------+----------+--------+
```

---

#### Example 2: Sorting in Descending Order

This query retrieves all employees and sorts them by their salary, from highest to lowest.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

**Result:**

```
+-----------+----------+--------+
| FirstName | LastName | Salary |
+-----------+----------+--------+
| Charlie   | Brown    |  95000 |
| Alice     | Smith    |  80000 |
| Diana     | Prince   |  72000 |
| Bob       | Johnson  |  65000 |
| Ethan     | Hunt     |  50000 |
+-----------+----------+--------+
```

---

### Practice Problems & Solutions (`ORDER BY`)

1. **Simple**: Write a query to get the list of all employees, sorted by their `LastName` alphabetically.
    
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT EmpID, FirstName, LastName
        FROM Employees
        ORDER BY LastName;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: This query selects the employees and then sorts the resulting rows alphabetically based on the `LastName` column. `ASC` is implied as it's the default.
2. **Intermediate**: Write a query to display all employees from the Engineering department (`DeptID` = 1), sorted by their `Salary` from lowest to highest.
    
    - **Query**:        
        ```sql
        SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
        FROM Employees
        WHERE DeptID = 1
        ORDER BY Salary ASC;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `WHERE` clause first filters the employees to include only those from the Engineering department. Then, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts that filtered result set by salary in ascending (`ASC`) order.

---
### The `GROUP BY` Clause

#### Concept

The **`GROUP BY`** clause is used with aggregate functions to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. Think of it as summarizing data.

Common aggregate functions used with `GROUP BY`:

- **`COUNT()`**: Counts the number of rows.
- **`SUM()`**: Calculates the sum of values.
- **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average of values.
- **`MAX()`**: Returns the maximum value.
- **`MIN()`**: Returns the minimum value.

---

#### Example 1: Counting Employees in Each Department

This query counts how many employees work in each department.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  DeptID,
  COUNT(EmpID) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY
  DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+--------+-------------------+
| DeptID | NumberOfEmployees |
+--------+-------------------+
|      1 |                 2 |
|      2 |                 2 |
|      3 |                 1 |
+--------+-------------------+
```

Explanation:

The GROUP BY DeptID clause first groups all the rows with the same DeptID (1, 2, and 3). Then, the COUNT(EmpID) function runs on each of those groups, counting the number of employees within it. AS NumberOfEmployees is an alias that renames the COUNT(EmpID) column for better readability.

---

#### Example 2: Calculating Average Salary per Department

This query calculates the average salary for each department.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  DeptID,
  AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY
  DeptID;
```

**Result:**

```
+--------+---------------+
| DeptID | AverageSalary |
+--------+---------------+
|      1 |    87500.0000 |
|      2 |    68500.0000 |
|      3 |    50000.0000 |
+--------+---------------+
```

Explanation:

The query groups the employees by their DeptID. Then, the AVG(Salary) function calculates the average salary for all employees within each of those department groups.

---

### Practice Problems & Solutions (`GROUP BY`)

1. **Simple**: Write a query to find the highest salary in each department.

    - **Query**:
    ```sql
        SELECT
          DeptID,
          MAX(Salary) AS HighestSalary
        FROM Employees
        GROUP BY
          DeptID;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: This groups employees by their `DeptID` and then uses the `MAX()` function to find the largest salary value within each group.
2. **Intermediate**: Write a query to find the total salary expense for each department, sorted from the highest total expense to the lowest.

    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          DeptID,
          SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaryExpense
        FROM Employees
        GROUP BY
          DeptID
        ORDER BY
          TotalSalaryExpense DESC;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: This first groups employees by `DeptID` and calculates the total salary for each group using `SUM()`. It then sorts the final summary rows in descending order based on that total salary.

---
### The `HAVING` Clause

#### Concept

The **`HAVING`** clause was added to SQL because the `WHERE` clause cannot be used with aggregate functions (like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.). `HAVING` is used to **filter the results of a `GROUP BY` query**.

**The Key Difference: `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`**

- **`WHERE`** filters individual **rows** _before_ any grouping happens.
- **`HAVING`** filters **groups** of rows _after_ the `GROUP BY` clause has created them.

---

#### Example: Finding Departments with More Than One Employee

You cannot use `WHERE` for this, because you need to filter based on the result of `COUNT()`, which is an aggregate.

**Query:**

SQL

```sql
SELECT
  DeptID,
  COUNT(EmpID) AS NumberOfEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY
  DeptID
HAVING
  COUNT(EmpID) > 1;
```

**Result:**

```
+--------+-------------------+
| DeptID | NumberOfEmployees |
+--------+-------------------+
|      1 |                 2 |
|      2 |                 2 |
+--------+-------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`GROUP BY DeptID`**: First, the rows are grouped by department. We have three groups: Dept 1 (2 employees), Dept 2 (2 employees), and Dept 3 (1 employee).
2. **`HAVING COUNT(EmpID) > 1`**: The `HAVING` clause then looks at these summary groups and keeps only the ones where the count is greater than 1. The group for DeptID 3 is filtered out.
3. **`SELECT`**: The final result is displayed.

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (`HAVING`)

1. **Problem**: Write a query to find the departments whose average salary is greater than 70,000.
    - **Query**:
        ```sql
        SELECT
          DeptID,
          AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
        FROM Employees
        GROUP BY
          DeptID
        HAVING
          AVG(Salary) > 70000;
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The query first groups the employees by department and calculates the `AVG(Salary)` for each group. The `HAVING` clause then filters these groups, returning only the `DeptID`s where the calculated average salary is more than 70,000.

---
You cannot use `WHERE` in that query because of the order in which SQL processes clauses. The `WHERE` clause filters individual rows **before** the `GROUP BY` clause creates the groups.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **`WHERE` clause is processed first**: It goes through the table row by row and decides which ones to keep for the next step. At this stage, there are no groups, so an aggregate function like `COUNT(EmpID)` has no meaning.
2. **`GROUP BY` clause is processed next**: It takes the rows that passed the `WHERE` filter and bundles them into groups.
3. **`HAVING` clause is processed last**: It filters these newly created **groups** based on the result of the aggregate function.

In short, `WHERE` filters rows, and `HAVING` filters groups. Since your condition `COUNT(EmpID) > 1` depends on the count of a group, you must use `HAVING`.
