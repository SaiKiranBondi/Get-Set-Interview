### File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

To maintain consistency across different Linux distributions, the **File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** defines the structure and contents of the main directories. Knowing this layout is essential for locating files, configurations, and logs.

Here are the most important directories:

- **`/` (root)**: The top-level directory of the entire file system. Every single file and directory starts from here.
- **`/bin`**: Contains essential **user binaries** that are needed for the system to function, even in single-user mode (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `cat`).
- **`/sbin`**: Contains essential **system binaries**, which are primarily used for system administration by the root user (e.g., `ifconfig`, `fdisk`, `reboot`).
- **`/etc`**: The central location for all system-wide **configuration files** (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`). This is a very important directory for developers and administrators.
- **`/home`**: Contains the personal **home directories** for users on the system (e.g., `/home/justin`).
- **`/var`**: Holds **variable data** files. The contents of these files are expected to grow, such as logs (`/var/log`), mail spools, and printer spools.
- **`/tmp`**: A directory for **temporary files**. Files stored here are often deleted upon system reboot.
- **`/usr`**: Contains user programs and data. It's one of the largest directories and has its own sub-hierarchy:
    - `/usr/bin`: Non-essential command binaries for all users.
    - `/usr/lib`: Libraries for the programs in `/usr/bin`.
    - `/usr/local`: Where locally compiled software is typically installed to keep it separate from the main system packages.
- **`/dev`**: Contains **device files**. Linux represents devices like hard drives (`/dev/sda`), terminals (`/dev/tty`), and even a null device (`/dev/null`) as files.
- **`/proc`**: A special, **virtual file system** that provides real-time information about processes and other system kernel information. For example, `/proc/cpuinfo` contains information about the CPU. It doesn't exist on a disk; the kernel creates it on the fly.

### Inodes (Index Nodes)

An **inode** is a data structure on the disk that stores all the metadata (information about a file) _except_ for its name and its actual data.
When a file system is created, a fixed number of inodes are also created. Each file or directory is allocated one inode.

**What an inode stores:**

- File type (e.g., regular file, directory, symbolic link).
- Permissions (read, write, execute).
- Owner (User ID) and Group (Group ID).
- File size in bytes.
- Timestamps (last access, last modification, last change).
- **Pointers** to the data blocks on the disk where the file's content is actually stored.

**How it works:** A directory is simply a special type of file whose content is a list mapping human-readable filenames to their corresponding inode numbers.

### File Permissions and Ownership

Linux uses a simple but powerful model to control access to files and directories.

- **Ownership**: Every file has a **user** (owner) and a **group**.
- **Permissions**: There are three types of permissions:
    - **Read (r)**: View the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
    - **Write (w)**: Modify a file or create/delete files within a directory.
    - **Execute (x)**: Run a file (if it's a script or program) or enter a directory (`cd`).

These permissions are set for three classes of users: the **user**, the **group**, and **others**.

When you run `ls -l`, you see a string like `-rwxr-xr--`:

- **First character (`-`)**: The file type (`d` for directory, `-` for regular file).
- **Next 3 (`rwx`)**: Permissions for the **user** (owner). Can read, write, and execute.
- **Next 3 (`r-x`)**: Permissions for the **group**. Can read and execute, but not write.
- **Last 3 (`r--`)**: Permissions for **others**. Can only read.

You can change permissions with `chmod` and ownership with `chown`.
