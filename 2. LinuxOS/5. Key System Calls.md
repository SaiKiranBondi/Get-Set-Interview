A system call is the bridge between a user application and the kernel. While there are hundreds of system calls, understanding the purpose of these key ones is essential.

These calls are the foundation for how programs interact with the operating system to manage processes and files.

### Process Creation

This is the standard Unix/Linux model for creating and running new programs.

- **`fork()`**
    - **Purpose**: To create a new process.
    - **Mechanism**: It creates a new child process that is an almost identical copy of the parent process. The child gets its own unique Process ID (PID) but shares the same code. The primary difference is the return value of the `fork()` call itself:
        - In the **parent** process, it returns the PID of the new child.
        - In the **child** process, it returns `0`.
    - This return value allows the program to branch its logic and execute different code in the parent and child.
- **`exec()`**
    - **Purpose**: To execute a new program.
    - **Mechanism**: The `exec()` family of functions replaces the memory image of the current process with a new program. The PID does not change, but the kernel loads a new binary, effectively transforming the current process into a different one. It does not return on success because the original program is gone.
    - **The `fork()`-then-`exec()` Pattern**: This is the standard way to launch a program in Linux. A parent process calls `fork()` to create a child, and then the child process calls `exec()` to become the new program. This is how your shell runs commands like `ls` or `grep`.
- **`wait()`**
    - **Purpose**: To wait for a child process to terminate.
    - **Mechanism**: A parent process calls `wait()` to pause its own execution until one of its child processes finishes. This allows the parent to get the child's exit status and ensures that "zombie" processes (terminated processes that still occupy an entry in the process table) are cleaned up properly.

### File I/O (Input/Output)

In Linux, everything is a file, so these system calls are used to interact with regular files, devices, sockets, and more.

- **`open()`**
    - **Purpose**: To open or create a file for access.
    - **Mechanism**: It takes a file path and access flags (e.g., read-only, write-only) and asks the kernel to prepare the file for I/O. On success, it returns a **file descriptor**.
    - A **file descriptor** is a small, non-negative integer (like 3, 4, 5, etc.) that acts as a handle for all subsequent operations on that file. The first three are standardized: 0 (standard input), 1 (standard output), and 2 (standard error).
- **`read()`**
    - **Purpose**: To read data from an open file.
    - **Mechanism**: It takes a file descriptor, a buffer (a space in memory), and a number of bytes to read. The kernel copies data from the file into the process's buffer.
- **`write()`**
    - **Purpose**: To write data to an open file.
    - **Mechanism**: It takes a file descriptor, a buffer containing data, and a number of bytes to write. The kernel copies the data from the process's buffer to the file.
- **`close()`**
    - **Purpose**: To end access to a file.
    - **Mechanism**: It takes a file descriptor and tells the kernel to release any data structures associated with that open file. It is important to close files when you are done with them to free up system resources.
