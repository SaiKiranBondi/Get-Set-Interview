Shell scripting is the practice of writing scripts to automate tasks that you would otherwise type on the command line. It's a powerful tool for system administrators and developers to handle repetitive jobs, combine complex command sequences, and perform basic automation.

Here are the fundamental building blocks of a shell script, typically using **Bash** (`/bin/bash`) as the interpreter.

### The Shebang `#!`

Every shell script should start with a "shebang." It's a special line that tells the operating system which interpreter to use to execute the script.

- **Syntax**: `#!/bin/bash`
- This must be the very first line of your script.

### Variables

Variables store data that can be used later in the script.

- Declaration and Assignment: Assign a value to a variable with no spaces around the equals sign.
    GREETING="Hello, World!"
    USER_COUNT=5
- Accessing Variables: Use a dollar sign $ before the variable name to get its value.
    echo $GREETING
    echo "There are $USER_COUNT users."

### Control Structures

These allow you to add logic and loops to your scripts.

- **`if-else` Statements**: Used to execute code based on a condition. The spaces inside the square brackets `[ ]` are mandatory.
    **Syntax & Example**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    FILENAME="test.txt"
    
    if [ -f "$FILENAME" ]; then
        echo "$FILENAME exists."
    else
        echo "$FILENAME does not exist."
    fi
    ```
    
- **`for` Loops**: Used to iterate over a sequence of items.
    
    **Syntax & Example**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    for i in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
       echo "Welcome $i times"
    done
    ```
    
- **`while` Loops**: Used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    
    **Syntax & Example**:
    
    Bash
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    COUNTER=0
    while [ $COUNTER -lt 5 ]; do
        echo "The counter is $COUNTER"
        let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
    done
    ```
    

### Command-Line Arguments

Your script can accept arguments from the command line, making it more flexible.

- `$1`, `$2`, etc.: Positional parameters representing the first argument, second argument, and so on.
- `$#`: The total number of command-line arguments passed to the script.
- `$?`: The exit status of the most recently executed command (0 for success, non-zero for failure).

Example:

Save the following as greet.sh:

Bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if an argument was provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: ./greet.sh <Your Name>"
    exit 1
fi

NAME=$1
echo "Hello, $NAME!"
```

To run it:

First, make it executable: chmod +x greet.sh

Then, run it with an argument: ./greet.sh Alice

Output: Hello, Alice!
