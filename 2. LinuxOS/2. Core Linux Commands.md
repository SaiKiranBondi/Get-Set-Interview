Here are the essential commands broken down by category.

### Process Management

These commands help you monitor and manage the processes running on the system.

- **`ps`** (Process Status): Displays information about currently running processes.
    - **Common Use**: `ps aux` or `ps -ef` will show all running processes on the system, including their Process ID (PID), CPU/memory usage, and the command that started them.
    
- **`top`**: Provides a real-time, dynamic view of the running system. It displays a list of the most CPU-intensive tasks and provides a summary of system usage. It's interactive, allowing you to sort processes and send signals.
    
- **`kill`**: Sends a signal to a process, most commonly to terminate it.
    - **Common Use**: `kill <PID>` sends a termination signal (SIGTERM), asking the process to shut down gracefully.
    - **Forceful Use**: `kill -9 <PID>` sends a "sure kill" signal (SIGKILL) that immediately stops the process without cleanup. This should be used as a last resort.
    
- **`nice`**: Influences the scheduling priority of a process. A higher "niceness" value means a lower priority, making the process "nicer" to other processes on the system.

### File Management

These are the commands you'll use constantly for navigating the file system and manipulating files.

- **`ls`**: Lists the contents of a directory.
    - **Common Use**: `ls -lah` is a popular combination. It shows a **l**ong listing, includes **a**ll (hidden) files, and displays sizes in a **h**uman-readable format.
    
- **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
    - **Common Use**: `cd /etc/` to navigate to the `/etc` directory, or `cd ..` to go up one level.

- **`cp`**: Copies files or directories.
    - **Common Use**: `cp source.txt destination.txt`. To copy a directory, you need the recursive flag: `cp -r sourcedir/ destinationdir/`.
        
- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files or directories.
    - **To Rename**: `mv old_name.txt new_name.txt`
    - **To Move**: `mv some_file.txt /home/user/documents/`
        
- **`rm`**: Removes files or directories.
    - **Common Use**: `rm some_file.txt`. To remove a directory and its contents, use the recursive flag: `rm -r directory_name`. Be careful, as this is permanent.
        
- **`find`**: Searches for files in a directory hierarchy.
    - **Common Use**: `find . -name "*.log"` will find all files ending with `.log` in the current directory and its subdirectories.
        
- **`ln`**: Creates links between files.
    - **Symbolic Link (Soft Link)**: `ln -s /path/to/original.txt link_name`. This creates a pointer or shortcut to the original file. This is the most common type of link.
    - **Hard Link**: `ln /path/to/original.txt link_name`. This creates another directory entry that points to the exact same inode on the disk.

### Text Processing

These commands are powerful tools for searching, filtering, and manipulating text directly from the command line.

- **`grep`**: Searches for patterns within text files.
    - **Common Use**: `grep "error" /var/log/syslog` will find all lines containing the word "error" in the system log.
        
- **`sed`**: A "stream editor" used to perform text transformations on an input stream.
    - **Common Use**: `sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' filename.txt` will replace all occurrences of `old_text` with `new_text` in a file.
        
- **`awk`**: A versatile programming language for pattern scanning and processing. It's excellent for manipulating column-based data.
    - **Common Use**: `ls -l | awk '{print $1, $9}'` will print only the permissions (`$1`) and filename (`$9`) from the output of `ls -l`.
        
- **`cat`**: Concatenates and displays the content of files.
    
- **`less`**: An interactive program for viewing long text files. It allows you to scroll up and down, which is an advantage over the `more` command.

### Networking

These commands are used to configure and troubleshoot network connections.

- **`ip`** / **`ifconfig`**: Used to view and configure network interfaces. `ifconfig` is older; `ip` is the modern standard.
    - **Common Use**: `ip addr show` will display the IP addresses and status of all network interfaces.
        
- **`ping`**: Checks network connectivity to another host by sending ICMP echo request packets.
    - **Common Use**: `ping google.com`
        
- **`netstat`** / **`ss`**: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. `ss` is the modern replacement for `netstat`.
    - **Common Use**: `netstat -tulpn` or `ss -tulpn` will show all active listening TCP and UDP ports and the programs using them.
        
- **`traceroute`**: Traces the network path (the sequence of routers) that packets take to reach a destination host.
