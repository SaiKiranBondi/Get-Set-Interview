Understanding the sequence of events from powering on the machine to getting a login prompt is key for system-level knowledge and troubleshooting. The process can be broken down into four main stages.

This is the high-level sequence of operations that a computer performs when it is powered on.

**Flowchart of the Boot Process**

### Stage 1: BIOS/UEFI (Firmware)

This is the first stage, handled by the computer's firmware.

- **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**: When you power on the machine, the **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or the modern **UEFI** (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) first runs a POST. This checks that essential hardware like RAM, keyboard, and disks are present and functional.

- **Locating the Bootloader**: After a successful POST, the firmware checks its configured boot order (e.g., USB Drive, Hard Drive) to find a bootable device.
    - On older BIOS systems, it reads the **MBR (Master Boot Record)** from the first sector of the disk, which contains the first stage of the bootloader.
    - On modern UEFI systems, it looks for a special EFI partition to find and load the bootloader application.

### Stage 2: Bootloader (GRUB)

The bootloader's job is to load the Linux kernel into memory.

- **GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)** is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions.
- GRUB is loaded into memory by the firmware. It often presents a menu that allows you to select which operating system or kernel version to boot.
- Once a selection is made (or a timeout occurs), GRUB locates the compressed kernel image file (often named **`vmlinuz`**) and the **`initramfs`** (initial RAM filesystem) on the disk.
- It loads both of these files into memory and then passes control over to the kernel.

### Stage 3: Kernel Initialization

Once the kernel is loaded into memory, it takes control and starts preparing the system.

- **Decompression**: The kernel first decompresses itself from its compressed format (`vmlinuz`).
- **Hardware Initialization**: It uses the `initramfs` to load necessary drivers (e.g., for the disk controller) so it can access the rest of the hardware and the main filesystem.
- **Mounting Root Filesystem**: The kernel mounts the root filesystem (`/`) in read-only mode to run a filesystem check (`fsck`). After the check, it remounts it in read-write mode.
- **Starting Init**: The kernel's job is nearly done. The last thing it does is start the very first user-space process, the **`init`** process.

### Stage 4: Init Process (systemd)

This is the final stage that brings the system to a usable state.

- The **`init`** process is the ancestor of all other processes on the system and always has a Process ID (PID) of **1**.
- Most modern Linux distributions use **`systemd`** as their init system.
- `systemd` reads its configuration files (known as "unit files") from directories like `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- It starts various system services and daemons based on these files, such as networking services, database services, and the graphical display manager.
- Once all the necessary services are started, `systemd` presents the user with a **login prompt**, and the boot process is complete.
