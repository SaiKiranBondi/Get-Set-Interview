### **1. The Client-Server Model**

This is the fundamental architecture that powers the entire internet and most modern applications. It describes a relationship between two types of computer programs.

- What is a Client?
    
    A client is a program or device that requests services or information. It's the part of the system that the user directly interacts with.
    
    - **Examples:** Your web browser (Chrome, Safari), a mobile app (Instagram, Uber), a desktop application (Spotify, Slack).
        
- What is a Server?
    
    A server is a powerful computer or program that provides services or information in response to client requests. It runs continuously, waiting for clients to connect and ask for something. It handles the "heavy lifting," like processing data, running business logic, and accessing the database.
    
- The Request-Response Cycle
    
    This is the sequence of communication between a client and a server.
    
    **Block Diagram:**
    
    ```
          +----------------+                           +-----------------+
          |                |      1. HTTP Request      |                 |
          |     Client     | ------------------------> |      Server     |
          | (e.g., Browser)|                           | (Processes Logic) |
          |                |      4. HTTP Response     |                 |
          +----------------+ <------------------------ +-----------------+
                                      ^        |
                                      | 2. Get | 3. Return
                                      | Data   | Data
                                      V        |
                                  +-----------------+
                                  |    Database     |
                                  +-----------------+
    ```
    
    1. **Request:** The client sends a request over the internet to the server's address (e.g., you type `google.com` in your browser and hit Enter). This request contains information like what you want (`GET` page), who you are (cookies), and other details.
        
    2. **Processing:** The server receives the request, understands what the client wants, and performs the necessary actions. This might involve calculations, running business logic, or fetching data from a database.
        
    3. **Database Interaction:** If needed, the server communicates with a database to retrieve or store information.
        
    4. **Response:** The server packages the results into a response (e.g., an HTML page, JSON data, an image) and sends it back to the client. The client then renders this response for the user.

### **2. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**

- What is an API?
    
    An API is a set of rules and definitions that allows two software applications to communicate with each other. It's a "contract" that defines the kinds of requests a client can make and the kinds of responses it can expect from a server. You don't need to know how the server works internally; you just need to know how to use its API.
    
- REST APIs
    
    REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is the most popular architectural style for designing web APIs. It's not a strict protocol but a set of guiding principles.
    
    - **Core Concepts:**
        
        - **Resources:** In REST, everything is a "resource." A resource is any piece of information that can be namedâ€”a user, a product, a photo, etc. Each resource is identified by a unique URL (e.g., `/users/123`, `/products/45`).
            
        - **HTTP Verbs (Methods):** The client tells the server what action to perform on a resource using standard HTTP methods.
            
            - `GET`: Retrieve a resource (e.g., `GET /users/123` to get user 123's profile).
                
            - `POST`: Create a new resource (e.g., `POST /users` to create a new user).
                
            - `PUT` / `PATCH`: Update an existing resource.
                
            - `DELETE`: Delete a resource.
                
        - **Status Codes:** The server uses standard HTTP status codes to tell the client the result of its request.
            
            - `200 OK`: The request was successful.
                
            - `201 Created`: A new resource was successfully created.
                
            - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
                
            - `400 Bad Request`: The client sent an invalid request.
                
            - `500 Internal Server Error`: Something went wrong on the server.
                
- Data Format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
    
    JSON is the de facto standard for exchanging data in modern APIs. It's a lightweight, human-readable text format that represents data as key-value pairs (like a Python dictionary).
    
    **Block Diagram: Sample API Interaction**
    
    ```
    Client Request:
    GET /api/users/42
    
    --------------------------------------------------->
    
    Server Response:
    Status: 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    Body (JSON):
    {
      "id": 42,
      "username": "alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "isActive": true
    }
    
    <---------------------------------------------------
    ```

### **3. Databases**

A database is an organized collection of data, managed by a **Database Management System (DBMS)**. The backend server interacts with the DBMS to store, retrieve, and update application data.

- **SQL (Relational) Databases**
    
    - **Concept:** Data is stored in highly structured **tables**, which are composed of **rows** and **columns**. The relationships between tables are strictly defined. This model is known for its reliability and consistency.
        
    - **Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.
        
    - **Key Ideas:**
        
        - **Schema:** The blueprint of the database that defines the tables, columns, data types, and relationships.
            
        - **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each row in a table (e.g., `user_id`).
            
        - **Foreign Key:** A key used to link two tables together.
            
    
    **Block Diagram: SQL Tables**
    
    ```
    Users Table                Posts Table
    +----+----------+         +----+----------+---------+
    | id | username |         | id | content  | user_id | (Foreign Key)
    +----+----------+         +----+----------+---------+
    | 1  | alice    |         | 101| "Hello"  | 1       | ----+
    +----+----------+         +----+----------+---------+     |
    | 2  | bob      |         | 102| "World"  | 1       | ----+
    +----+----------+         +----+----------+---------+
    ```
    
- **NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases**
    
    - **Concept:** A broad category of databases that do not use the traditional table-based structure of relational databases. They offer more flexibility and are often used for large-scale, rapidly changing data.
        
    - **Examples:** MongoDB (Document), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Column-family).
        
    - **Types:**
        
        - **Document Stores:** Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
            
        - **Key-Value Stores:** The simplest model. Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs.
            
    
    **Block Diagram: NoSQL Document**
    
    ```
    User Document (in MongoDB)
    
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "username": "alice",
      "posts": [
        { "post_id": 101, "content": "Hello" },
        { "post_id": 102, "content": "World" }
      ]
    }
    ```

### **4. Authentication vs. Authorization**

These are two critical security concepts that are often confused but have distinct meanings.

- Authentication (AuthN): "Who are you?"
    
    This is the process of verifying a user's identity. The system asks for credentials (like a username and password) and checks if they are valid. If they are, the user is considered "authenticated."
    
- Authorization (AuthZ): "What are you allowed to do?"
    
    This process happens after a user has been successfully authenticated. It determines the permissions that the authenticated user has. It answers questions like, "Is this user an admin?", "Is this user allowed to view this page?", or "Can this user delete this post?".
    

**Analogy: Flying on an Airplane**

1. **Authentication:** At the check-in counter, you show your ID and ticket to prove you are who you say you are.
    
2. **Authorization:** At the gate, your boarding pass is scanned. This checks if you are allowed to board _this specific flight_ (First Class, Business, Economy). You are authorized to sit in your assigned seat, but not in the cockpit.
    

- **Common Mechanisms:**
    
    - **Sessions/Cookies:** A traditional method where the server creates a session for an authenticated user and gives the client a cookie with a session ID to include in future requests.
        
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A modern, stateless method. After authentication, the server gives the client a signed token (the JWT) containing their identity and permissions. The client sends this token with every request, and the server can verify it without needing to check a database.
