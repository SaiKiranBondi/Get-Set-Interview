## Backend, Django, IoT & AWS Learning Plan

### **Part 1: General Backend & Web Concepts**

1. **The Client-Server Model**
    
    - What is a Client? (e.g., a web browser, a mobile app)
        
    - What is a Server? (The "brain" that processes requests)
        
    - The Request-Response Cycle: How they communicate.
        
2. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**
    
    - What is an API? The "contract" that defines how software components interact.
        
    - **REST APIs:** The most common architectural style for web APIs.
        
        - Core Concepts: Resources, HTTP Verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), Status Codes (`200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Error`).
            
    - Data Formats: **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) - the universal language of modern APIs.
        
3. **Databases**
    
    - **SQL (Relational) Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
        
        - Concept: Data is stored in structured tables with rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
            
        - Key Ideas: Schemas, Tables, Primary Keys, Foreign Keys.
            
    - **NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:** (e.g., MongoDB, Redis)
        
        - Concept: More flexible data models, not restricted to tables.
            
        - Types: Document stores (JSON-like), Key-Value stores, etc.
            
4. **Authentication vs. Authorization**
    
    - **Authentication:** "Who are you?" - Verifying a user's identity (e.g., with a username/password).
        
    - **Authorization:** "What are you allowed to do?" - Checking a user's permissions after they are authenticated.
        
    - Common Mechanisms: Sessions, Cookies, JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
        

### **Part 2: Django Framework (Conceptual)**

5. **What is a Framework? Why use one?**
    
    - Concept: A framework provides a structure and pre-written components so you don't have to build everything from scratch.
        
    - Django's Philosophy: "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY), "Batteries-included".
        
6. **The MVT Architecture (Model-View-Template)**
    
    - **Model:** The single, definitive source of your data. It defines the structure of your database tables using Python classes.
        
    - **View:** The business logic. It receives a web request, interacts with the Model to get data, and decides what response to send back.
        
    - **Template:** The presentation layer. It's an HTML file with special syntax that the View uses to render the final webpage with the data it fetched.
        
7. **Core Django Components**
    
    - **The ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** The magic that lets you interact with your SQL database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.
        
    - **The URL Dispatcher:** Maps incoming URL paths (e.g., `/products/5/`) to the correct View function.
        
    - **The Admin Site:** An automatically generated, production-ready interface for managing your site's data.
        

### **Part 3: Servers, Clients & The Internet of Things (IoT)**

8. **Building a Simple Server & Client (Python Sockets)**
    
    - **Concept:** Understanding the low-level network communication that powers everything.
        
    - **Sockets:** The endpoints of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network.
        
    - **Code Examples:**
        
        - A simple TCP server in Python that listens for connections.
            
        - A simple TCP client in Python that connects to the server and sends a message.
            
9. **Introduction to IoT**
    
    - **What is IoT?** A network of physical devices ("things") embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.
        
    - **Key Components:**
        
        - **Device/Sensor:** The "thing" that collects data (e.g., a temperature sensor, a smart lightbulb).
            
        - **Gateway:** A device that aggregates data from sensors and sends it to the cloud.
            
        - **Cloud/Server:** The backend that receives, processes, and stores the data from the devices.
            
        - **Application:** A user interface (e.g., a mobile app) to monitor and control the devices.
            
10. **IoT Communication Protocols**
    
    - **HTTP:** Common, but can be too "heavy" for small devices.
        
    - **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** A lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol. It's the standard for IoT because it's efficient and works well on unreliable networks.
        

### **Part 4: Cloud Computing with AWS (Amazon Web Services)**

11. **What is Cloud Computing?**
    
    - Concept: Renting computing resources (servers, storage, databases) from another company (like Amazon) instead of owning and maintaining your own.
        
    - Key Models: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service).
        
12. **Core AWS Services for a Backend Developer**
    
    - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** The foundation. This is where you rent virtual servers (like a Linux machine) to run your backend code.
        
    - **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** An object storage service. Perfect for storing user-uploaded files, images, videos, and static website assets.
        
    - **RDS (Relational Database Service):** A managed service for running SQL databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. AWS handles backups, patching, and scaling for you.
        
    - **Lambda:** A "serverless" compute service. You upload your code (a function), and AWS automatically runs and scales it in response to events, without you ever needing to manage a server.
        
13. **Interacting with AWS (Boto3 SDK for Python)**
    
    - **Concept:** You can control and manage your AWS resources programmatically using an SDK (Software Development Kit).
        
    - **Boto3:** The official AWS SDK for Python.
        
    - **Code Examples:**
        
        - A simple Python script using Boto3 to list all your S3 buckets.
            
        - A simple Python script to upload a file to an S3 bucket.
