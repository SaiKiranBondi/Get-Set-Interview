### Topic 2: Intermediate & Interview-Critical Concepts

#### Mutable vs. Immutable Types

This is one of the most common Python interview topics. The distinction is about whether an object's value can be changed after it has been created.

- **Immutable Objects**: An object whose state **cannot be changed** after it is created. If you try to modify it, Python will create a new object in memory.
    - **Types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `tuple`.
    - **Analogy**: Think of it like a signed contract. You can't alter it; you can only create a new, amended contract. 📜
- **Mutable Objects**: An object whose state **can be changed** after it is created. You can modify its contents in place without creating a new object.
    - **Types**: `list`, `dict`, `set`.
    - **Analogy**: Think of it like a shopping list in a notebook. You can add or cross off items without needing a new piece of paper. 📝

##### Example: Immutability of a String (`str`)

Python

```python
# A string is immutable
my_string = "hello"
print(f"Original string ID: {id(my_string)}")

# This does NOT change the original string.
# It creates a NEW string object.
my_string = my_string + " world"
print(f"New string ID:      {id(my_string)}")
```

**Explanation**: Notice that the memory ID changes. You didn't modify the original "hello" string; you created a completely new string "hello world" and pointed the variable `my_string` to it.

---

##### Example: Mutability of a List (`list`)

Python

```python
# A list is mutable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(f"Original list ID: {id(my_list)}")

# This modifies the list in-place.
# No new object is created.
my_list.append(4)
print(f"Modified list ID: {id(my_list)}")
print(f"List contents: {my_list}")
```

**Explanation**: The memory ID remains the same. You have modified the original list object directly. This behavior is crucial to understand, especially when passing lists or dictionaries as arguments to functions, as any changes made inside the function will affect the original object.

---
### *List Comprehensions*

**List comprehensions** offer a short, elegant, and highly readable syntax for creating a list based on an existing iterable. It is often considered a more **"Pythonic"** way to create lists compared to using a traditional `for` loop and the `.append()` method.

**Syntax**: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

---

#### Example 1: Creating a List of Squares

Let's say you want to create a list of the squares of numbers from 0 to 4.

**The Traditional `for` loop way:**

Python

```python
squares = []
for i in range(5):
    squares.append(i * i)

print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

**The List Comprehension way:**

Python

```python
squares = [i * i for i in range(5)]

print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

**Explanation**: The list comprehension achieves the same result in a single, more readable line of code.

---

#### Example 2: Filtering with a Condition

Now let's create a new list containing only the even numbers from an existing list.

**The Traditional `for` loop way:**

Python

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
evens = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(num)

print(evens)
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**The List Comprehension way:**

Python

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
evens = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(evens)
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Explanation**: The optional `if` statement at the end of the comprehension acts as a filter, only including items that meet the condition.

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (List Comprehension)

1. **Problem**: Given a list of words, use a list comprehension to create a new list containing the uppercase version of only the words that are more than 4 letters long.
    
    - **Solution**:
        ```python
        words = ["apple", "cat", "banana", "dog", "elephant"]
        long_words_upper = [word.upper() for word in words if len(word) > 4]
        print(long_words_upper)
        # Output: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'ELEPHANT']
        ```
        
    - **Explanation**: The `if len(word) > 4` part filters the list to include only the longer words. The `word.upper()` expression is then applied to each of those filtered words.
        
---
### *Generators and Iterators*

#### Concept

A **generator** is a special type of function that creates an iterator. Generators don't return a single value; instead, they **yield** a sequence of values one at a time.

The key benefit of a generator is **memory efficiency**. A normal function that returns a list has to create the entire list in memory first. A generator, however, produces values on the fly and doesn't store them all in memory. This makes them ideal for working with very large datasets or even infinite sequences.

The magic happens with the **`yield`** keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object. Each time you iterate over it (e.g., with a `for` loop), the function's code runs until it hits `yield`. It then sends the yielded value back and pauses its state, ready to resume from the same spot on the next iteration.

---

#### Example: Generator vs. a Regular Function

Let's compare a function that returns a list to one that yields values.

**The Traditional Function (returns a list):**

Python

```python
# This function builds the entire list in memory
def get_numbers_list(n):
    nums = []
    for i in range(n):
        nums.append(i)
    return nums

# If n is very large, this will consume a lot of memory
numbers = get_numbers_list(1000000)
```

**The Generator Function (uses `yield`):**

Python

```python
# This function returns a generator object instantly
def get_numbers_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

# This creates a generator object but uses almost no memory
# The numbers are generated only as the loop requests them
numbers_gen = get_numbers_generator(1000000)

for num in numbers_gen:
    # Do something with each number
    pass
```

---
## Clear Explaination

### The Normal Function (`get_numbers_list`)

This function builds a complete list of numbers in memory before returning it.

**Code:**

Python

```python
def get_numbers_list(n):
    nums = []
    for i in range(n):
        nums.append(i)
    return nums
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. When you call `get_numbers_list(1000000)`, the function starts executing immediately.
2. It creates an empty list called `nums`.
3. The `for` loop runs one million times, and each time, a number is added to the `nums` list.
4. After the loop finishes, the function returns the entire list, which now contains one million numbers.
5. This massive list is then stored in the `numbers` variable, consuming a large amount of memory all at once.

---

### The Generator Function (`get_numbers_generator`)

This function uses the **`yield`** keyword, which completely changes its behavior. It doesn't build a list; it returns a special object called a **generator** that produces values one at a time, on demand.

**Code:**

Python

```python
def get_numbers_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. When you call `get_numbers_generator(1000000)`, the function **does not execute its code**. Instead, it instantly returns a **generator object** and assigns it to the `numbers_gen` variable. This step uses almost no memory.
2. The code inside the generator only runs when you ask for its next value, which is what a `for` loop does automatically.
3. The first time the `for num in numbers_gen:` loop asks for a value:
    - The generator function starts running.
    - The loop begins, `i` becomes `0`.
    - It hits `yield i`. The function **pauses** its execution right there and "yields" the value `0`
4. The `for` loop receives the value `0` and does something with it. Then it asks for the next value.
5. The generator function **resumes** exactly where it left off.
    - The loop continues, `i` becomes `1`.
    - It hits `yield i` again, pauses, and yields the value `1`.
6. This process repeats. The generator function only ever holds one value in memory at a time and "forgets" the previous one after yielding it. It only remembers where it needs to resume from.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

|Feature|Normal Function (List)|Generator Function (Yield)|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory Usage**|**High**. Builds the entire list in memory at once.|**Very Low**. Only holds one value in memory at a time.|
|**Execution**|**Immediate**. Computes all values before returning.|**Lazy**. Computes values only when they are requested.|
|**Return Value**|Returns the entire list.|Returns a generator object.|

In short, the generator is much more memory-efficient because it streams the data to you one piece at a time, rather than handing you a giant box with everything in it at once.

---

#### Generator Expressions

You can create a simple generator on the fly using a syntax that looks like a list comprehension but with parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.

Python

```python
# List comprehension (creates the full list in memory)
my_list = [i * i for i in range(10)]

# Generator expression (creates a memory-efficient generator object)
my_generator = (i * i for i in range(10))

# You must iterate to get the values
for square in my_generator:
    print(square)
```

---

### Practice Problem & Solution (Generator)

1. **Problem**: Write a generator function that yields the Fibonacci sequence indefinitely.
    
    - **Solution**:
        ```python
        def fibonacci_generator():
            a, b = 0, 1
            while True:
                yield a
                a, b = b, a + b
        
        # How to use it:
        fib_gen = fibonacci_generator()
        for _ in range(10): # Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
            print(next(fib_gen))
        ```
    - **Explanation**: The `while True` loop allows the generator to run forever. The `yield a` statement returns the current Fibonacci number and pauses execution, saving the state of `a` and `b`. The next time `next()` is called on the generator, it resumes from that point. This would be impossible with a regular function returning a list.

### Decorators

#### Concept

A **decorator** is a design pattern in Python that allows you to add new functionality to an existing function without permanently modifying its code. Decorators are a powerful feature that makes code more modular and reusable.

In essence, a decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, "wraps" it in some extra code, and returns the wrapped function. The `@decorator_name` syntax you see is just a clean shortcut for this process.

---

#### Code Example

A very common use case for a decorator is to log when a function is called.

Python

```python
# This is our decorator function
def log_function_call(func):
    # The wrapper function contains the new functionality
    def wrapper():
        print(f"Calling function '{func.__name__}'...")
        func()  # This is where the original function is called
        print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' finished.")
    return wrapper

# We apply the decorator to our function using the '@' syntax
@log_function_call
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

# Now, when we call say_hello, the logging functionality is automatically included.
say_hello()
```

**Output:**

```
Calling function 'say_hello'...
Hello, world!
Function 'say_hello' finished.
```

Explanation:

The @log_function_call syntax is a shortcut for say_hello = log_function_call(say_hello). Our say_hello variable no longer points to the original function but to the wrapper function returned by the decorator. When we call say_hello(), we are actually executing the wrapper, which runs its own code before and after executing the original say_hello function.

---
### Lambda Functions

A **Lambda function** is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression.

While you can use the `def` keyword to create a normal named function, you use `lambda` for short, simple, and often temporary functions that you don't need to name.

- **Syntax**: `lambda arguments: expression`
    
- **Key Characteristics**:
    
    - They are anonymous (they don't have a name).
        
    - They can take any number of arguments.
        
    - They can only have one expression, and the result of this expression is what the function returns.
        

---

#### Code Example

Let's compare a regular function with a lambda function that does the same thing: adds 10 to a number.

**Regular Function Definition:**

Python

```
def add_ten(x):
  return x + 10

print(add_ten(5))
# Output: 15
```

**Lambda Function:**

Python

```
add_ten_lambda = lambda x: x + 10

print(add_ten_lambda(5))
# Output: 15
```

**Explanation:**

The lambda function achieves the same result in a single line. Its primary use case is for situations where you need a simple, short-lived function, often as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()` or `filter()`.

For example, to double every number in a list:

Python

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))

print(doubled_numbers)
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

---
### File Handling

#### Concept

File handling is the process of working with files on your computer, such as reading data from a file or writing data to a file. The modern and recommended way to do this in Python is with the `with open(...)` statement.

The `with` statement is a **context manager** that automatically handles closing the file for you, even if errors occur. This is the best practice as it prevents resource leaks.

---

#### Code Example: Reading a File

This example shows how to open a text file named `example.txt` and read its contents line by line.

Python

```
# Assume you have a file named 'example.txt' with these lines:
# Line 1
# Line 2

try:
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as f: # 'r' is the mode for reading
        for line in f:
            print(line.strip()) # .strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file was not found.")

```

**Output:**

```
Line 1
Line 2
```

**Explanation**: The `with open(...)` statement opens the file and assigns it to the variable `f`. The `for` loop iterates over each line in the file object `f`. Once the `with` block is finished, Python automatically closes the file.

---

#### Code Example: Writing to a File

This example shows how to write content to a file.

- `'w'` mode (write): **Overwrites** the file if it exists, or creates it if it doesn't.
    
- `'a'` mode (append): **Adds** content to the end of an existing file without deleting its current content.
    

Python

```
# Using 'w' to write to a new file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("This is the first line.\n")
    f.write("This is the second line.\n")

# Using 'a' to append to the same file
with open('output.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write("This line was appended.\n")
```

**Explanation**: After running this code, a file named `output.txt` will be created with three lines of text. The first `with` block creates the file and writes the first two lines. The second `with` block opens the same file and adds the third line to the end.
