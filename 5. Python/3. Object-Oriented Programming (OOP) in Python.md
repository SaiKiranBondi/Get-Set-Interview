#### Concept: Classes and Objects

**Object-Oriented Programming** is a way of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual **objects**.

- **Class**: A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that all objects of that class will have.
- **Object**: An **object** is an instance of a class. It's the actual thing you create from the blueprint, with its own specific data.

**Analogy**: A class is like a `blueprint` for a car. An object is the actual `car` you build from it, with its own specific color and VIN. ðŸš—

#### The `__init__()` Method

`__init__()` is a special method in a class, often called the **constructor**. It is automatically called whenever you create a new object from the class. Its job is to initialize the object's attributes.

The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class itself, allowing the object to store and access its own data.

---

#### Code Example

Let's create a `Dog` class.

Python

```python
class Dog:
    # The constructor method
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # These are the attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        print(f"{self.name} has been created!")

    # This is a method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# Create two different Dog objects (instances) from the Dog class
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Lucy", 5)

# Access their attributes and call their methods
print(f"{dog1.name} is {dog1.age} years old.")
print(dog2.bark())
```

**Output:**

```
Buddy has been created!
Lucy has been created!
Buddy is 3 years old.
Lucy says Woof!
```

Explanation:

We defined a Dog blueprint. When we created dog1 and dog2, the __init__ method ran for each, setting their unique name and age. Each object then has its own data and can perform the actions (methods) defined in the class.

### The Four Pillars of OOP: Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism that allows a new class (the **child** or **subclass**) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (the **parent** or **superclass**).

The main benefit is **code reuse**. It establishes an "is-a" relationship, meaning a child class "is a" more specific version of its parent. For example, a `GoldenRetriever` _is a_ `Dog`.

---

#### Code Example

Let's extend our `Dog` class to create a more specific `GoldenRetriever` class.

Python

```python
# This is the Parent class
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

# This is the Child class, which inherits from Dog
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    def __init__(self, name, age, coat_color):
        # Use super() to call the parent's __init__ method
        super().__init__(name, age)
        # Add a new attribute specific to this subclass
        self.coat_color = coat_color

    # Override the parent's speak method
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says a happy 'Woof!'"
        
    # Add a new method unique to GoldenRetriever
    def fetch(self):
        return f"{self.name} is fetching the ball!"

# Create an object of the child class
my_retriever = GoldenRetriever("Sunny", 2, "golden")

# Accessing methods and attributes
print(my_retriever.name)         # Inherited from Dog
print(my_retriever.speak())      # Overridden method from GoldenRetriever
print(my_retriever.fetch())      # New method from GoldenRetriever
print(my_retriever.coat_color) # New attribute from GoldenRetriever
```

**Explanation**:

1. **`class GoldenRetriever(Dog):`**: This line signifies that `GoldenRetriever` inherits from `Dog`.
    
2. **`super().__init__(name, age)`**: This calls the `__init__` method of the parent (`Dog`) class, so we don't have to rewrite the code for `self.name` and `self.age`.
    
3. **Overriding**: We defined a new `speak()` method in the child class, which overrides the parent's version.
    
4. The `GoldenRetriever` object has access to everything from the `Dog` class, plus its own specific attributes and methods.

### The Four Pillars of OOP: Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or "capsule"â€”the **class**.

A key part of encapsulation is **information hiding**: restricting direct access to an object's internal state. This prevents accidental or unauthorized modification of an object's data from outside the class.

In Python, we don't have true "private" variables like in Java or C++, but we use a naming convention:

- `self.name`: **Public** - Can be accessed from anywhere.
    
- `self._name`: **Protected** - A convention indicating it should not be accessed from outside the class, but it's still possible.
    
- `self.__name`: **Private** - Enforced by the interpreter through **name mangling**.
    

---

#### Code Example

Let's create a `BankAccount` class where the balance should not be directly changed.

Python

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        # The double underscore makes this attribute "private"
        self.__balance = initial_balance

    # Public method to deposit money
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited: ${amount}")

    # Public method to withdraw money
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew: ${amount}")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount.")

    # A "getter" method to allow controlled read-only access
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Create an account object
account = BankAccount(1000)

# Use the public methods to interact with the object's state
account.deposit(500)
print(f"Current Balance: ${account.get_balance()}")

# Now, try to change the balance directly (this will fail)
try:
    account.__balance = 0
    print("Balance set to 0.")
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error trying to access directly: {e}")

print(f"Final Balance: ${account.get_balance()}")
```

**Output:**

```
Deposited: $500
Current Balance: $1500
Error trying to access directly: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'
Final Balance: $1500
```

Explanation:

We cannot access or change account.__balance directly from outside the class. This is because Python performs name mangling, renaming the attribute internally to something like _BankAccount__balance. The only way to modify the balance is through the deposit() and withdraw() methods we provided, which allows the class to control its own data and ensure its integrity.

### The Four Pillars of OOP: Polymorphism

**Polymorphism**, which means "many forms," is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own, class-specific way. It allows you to write flexible code that can work with objects of different classes through a unified interface.

**Analogy**: Think of a "start" button. Pressing "start" on a car, a dishwasher, and a computer all perform the same action (calling the `start()` method), but the result is completely different for each object. ðŸš—

---

#### Code Example

Let's create a few different animal classes that all have a `speak()` method.

Python

```
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Bird:
    def speak(self):
        return "Tweet!"

# Create a list containing objects of different classes
animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Bird()]

# We can iterate through the list and call the same .speak() method on each object,
# and each object will respond in its own way.
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())

```

**Output:**

```
Woof!
Meow!
Tweet!
```

Explanation:

Even though our for loop is generic and simply calls animal.speak(), Python automatically determines which speak() method to run based on the class of the current animal object. This makes the code highly flexible. You could add a new Cow class with its own speak() method, and the loop would work perfectly without any changes. This is often referred to as duck typing in Python ("If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.").

---
### The Four Pillars of OOP: Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the principle of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It defines a blueprint for what a class should do, but not _how_ it should do it.

**Analogy**: Think of driving a car. You interact with a simple interface (steering wheel, pedals, gear stick). You don't need to know the complex details of the engine or transmission to drive. This simplified interface is an **abstraction**.

In Python, abstraction is typically achieved using **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**. An abstract class is a blueprint that cannot be used to create an object directly. Instead, other classes must inherit from it and implement its abstract methods.

---

#### Code Example

Let's create an abstract `Animal` class that defines a required `speak` method.

Python

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# This is an Abstract Base Class (a blueprint)
class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def speak(self):
        # An abstract method has no implementation
        pass

# This is a concrete class that inherits from Animal
class Dog(Animal):
    # It MUST implement the speak() method defined in the blueprint
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Another concrete class
class Cat(Animal):
    # It also MUST implement the speak() method
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"


# Try to create an object from the abstract class (this will raise an error)
try:
    animal = Animal()
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# You can create objects from the concrete classes
my_dog = Dog()
my_cat = Cat()

print(my_dog.speak())
print(my_cat.speak())
```

**Output:**

```
Error: Can't instantiate abstract class Animal with abstract method speak
Woof!
Meow!
```

**Explanation**:

1. The `Animal` class is a contract. By inheriting from it, the `Dog` and `Cat` classes promise to provide their own implementation of the `speak()` method.
    
2. The `@abstractmethod` decorator enforces this contract. If you tried to create a `Dog` class without a `speak()` method, Python would raise an error.
    
3. This ensures that any object that "is an" `Animal` is guaranteed to have a `speak()` method, which is very useful for writing reliable, polymorphic code.

### Magic Methods (Dunder Methods)

#### Concept

**Magic Methods**, also known as **Dunder Methods** (for **D**ouble **Under**score), are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores, like `__init__()` or `__str__()`.

You don't call these methods directly. Instead, Python calls them for you in response to specific actions or built-in functions. They allow your custom objects to integrate with Python's native syntax and behave like built-in types (for example, using the `+` operator or the `len()` function on your objects).

---

#### Code Example

Let's create a `Vector` class to represent a 2D vector and give it some "magic" behaviors.

Python

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Called by str() and print(). Should be user-friendly.
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector ({self.x}, {self.y})"

    # Called by repr(). Should be unambiguous, for developers.
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

    # Called when using the '+' operator.
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    # Called when using the len() function.
    def __len__(self):
        return 2

# Create some Vector objects
v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(3, 4)

# --- See the magic in action ---

# 1. The '+' operator calls __add__
v3 = v1 + v2

# 2. The print() function calls __str__
print(v3)

# 3. The len() function calls __len__
print(f"The vector has {len(v3)} dimensions.")

# 4. Inspecting the object in a shell would call __repr__
print(repr(v3))
```

**Output:**

```
Vector (5, 7)
The vector has 2 dimensions.
Vector(5, 7)
```

**Explanation**:

- `v1 + v2` worked because we defined the `__add__` method. Python translated the `+` into a call to `v1.__add__(v2)`.
    
- `print(v3)` gave a clean output because we defined the `__str__` method.
    
- `len(v3)` worked because we defined the `__len__` method.
