A **Regular Expression** (or **regex**) is a special sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. It's an incredibly powerful tool for finding, matching, and manipulating text. Python's built-in **`re`** module is used to work with regular expressions.

**Important Tip**: Always use raw strings (`r"..."`) for your patterns in Python. This tells Python not to interpret backslashes (`\`) as escape sequences.

#### Core `re` Module Functions

##### `re.search(pattern, string)`

This function scans through a string, looking for the **first location** where the pattern produces a match. It returns a **match object** if found, otherwise it returns `None`.

Python

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
match = re.search(r"brown", text)

if match:
    print("Match found!")
else:
    print("No match.")
```

**Output:** `Match found!`

---

##### `re.findall(pattern, string)`

This function finds **all** non-overlapping matches of the pattern in a string and returns them as a **list of strings**.

Python

```python
import re

text = "My numbers are 123, 456, and 789."
numbers = re.findall(r"\d+", text)

print(numbers)
```

**Output:** `['123', '456', '789']`

---

##### `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`

This function replaces all occurrences of the pattern in a string with a `replacement` string.

Python

```python
import re

text = "Hello 123, my name is agent 456."
redacted_text = re.sub(r"\d+", "XXX", text)

print(redacted_text)
```

**Output:** `Hello XXX, my name is agent XXX.`

#### Common Patterns & Metacharacters

- `\d` - Matches any digit (0-9).
    
- `\w` - Matches any alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _).
    
- `\s` - Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).
    
- `.` - Matches any character except a newline.
    
- `+` - Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character. (`\d+` matches one or more digits).
    
- `*` - Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
    
- `[]` - Matches any single character within the brackets (e.g., `[aeiou]`).
