#### Basic Data Types

- **int**: Integer numbers, e.g., `10`, `-50`.
- **float**: Floating-point (decimal) numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.01`.
- **str**: String (text) data, enclosed in single or double quotes, e.g., `'hello'`, `"world"`.
- **bool**: Boolean values, which are either `True` or `False`.

#### Core Data Structures

- **List**: An ordered, changeable (mutable) collection of items. Allows duplicate members.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    my_list = [1, "apple", 3.14, "apple"]
    ```
    
- **Tuple**: An ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collection of items. Allows duplicate members.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, "apple", 3.14, "apple")
    ```
    
- **Dictionary**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
    ```
    
- **Set**: An unordered, unindexed collection of unique items. No duplicate members.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    my_set = {1, "apple", 3.14}
    ```

#### Control Flow

- **`if/elif/else`**: Executes code based on conditions.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    x = 10
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    elif x == 5:
        print("x is 5")
    else:
        print("x is less than 5")
    ```
    
- **Loops**: Repeats a block of code.
    
    Python
    
    ```python
    # For loop
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"Loop {i}")
    
    # While loop
    count = 0
    while count < 3:
        print(f"Count is {count}")
        count += 1
    ```
    

---

#### Functions

A block of code that only runs when it is called.

Python

```python
def greet(name):
  """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter."""
  return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Call the function
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
```

### What is `if __name__ == '__main__':`?

This is a special conditional block in Python that determines whether the script is being run directly by the user or if it has been imported as a module into another script.

#### How it Works

Every Python script has a built-in special variable called `__name__`. The Python interpreter sets the value of `__name__` based on how you are using the script.

1. **When you run the script directly**: If you execute your script from the command line (e.g., `python my_script.py`), the interpreter assigns the string `'__main__'` to the `__name__` variable.
    
2. **When you import the script as a module**: If you import your script into another file (e.g., `import my_script`), the interpreter assigns the name of the script itself (e.g., `'my_script'`) to the `__name__` variable.
    

The `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement checks for this. The code inside this block will **only** run when the script is executed directly.

---

### Example

Let's say we have two files.

**File 1: `my_script.py`**

Python

```
def my_function():
    print("This is my_function running.")

print(f"The __name__ in my_script.py is: {__name__}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("my_script.py is being run directly.")
    my_function()
```

**File 2: `importer.py`**

Python

```
import my_script

print("Running code from importer.py")
my_script.my_function()
```

---

### Scenarios

Scenario 1: Running my_script.py directly

You run this command in your terminal: python my_script.py

**Output:**

```
The __name__ in my_script.py is: __main__
my_script.py is being run directly.
This is my_function running.
```

- **Explanation**: Because we ran it directly, `__name__` was `'__main__'`, and the code inside the `if` block was executed.
    

Scenario 2: Running importer.py (which imports my_script.py)

You run this command: python importer.py

**Output:**

```
The __name__ in my_script.py is: my_script
Running code from importer.py
This is my_function running.
```

- **Explanation**: When `importer.py` was run, it executed the `import my_script` line. At that moment, the interpreter ran the code in `my_script.py`, but it set `__name__` to `'my_script'`. Therefore, the `if __name__ == '__main__':` condition was **false**, and the code inside that block was skipped.
    

This allows you to write a file that can be used as a reusable module by other scripts, while also having a section of code that runs only when you want to test that specific file.
