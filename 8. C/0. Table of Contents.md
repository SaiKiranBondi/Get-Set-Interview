### **Part 1: C Language Fundamentals**

1. **Basic Syntax & Program Structure**
    
    - The `main()` Function: The entry point of every C program.
        
    - Header Files: Understanding `#include <stdio.h>` and others.
        
    - Standard I/O: Using `printf()` and `scanf()`.
        
    - Compiling and Running a C program.
        
2. **Variables & Data Types**
    
    - Primitive Types: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`.
        
    - Type Modifiers: `short`, `long`, `long long`, `unsigned`.
        
    - Constants: `const` keyword.
        
    - Type Casting: Explicitly converting between types.
        
3. **Operators**
    
    - Arithmetic, Relational, and Logical Operators.
        
    - **Bitwise Operators:** `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift).
        
    - **Increment/Decrement Deep Dive:** The conceptual and execution difference between `++i` (pre-increment) and `i++` (post-increment).
        
4. **Control Flow**
    
    - Conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and the Ternary Operator.
        
    - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
        
    - The `switch` statement.
        

### **Part 2: Core C Concepts (The Power & The Danger)**

5. **Pointers: The Heart of C**
    
    - What is a Pointer? Understanding memory addresses.
        
    - The `&` (address-of) and `*` (dereference) operators.
        
    - Pointer Arithmetic.
        
    - `NULL` Pointers and their importance.
        
    - Pointers and Arrays: The critical relationship.
        
    - Pointers to Pointers (Double Pointers).
        
6. **Functions**
    
    - Function Declaration (Prototypes) vs. Definition.
        
    - **Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference (using pointers):** A conceptual cornerstone.
        
    - Recursion in C.
        
7. **Memory Management: The Stack vs. The Heap**
    
    - Understanding automatic (stack) and dynamic (heap) memory.
        
    - **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
        
        - `malloc()`: Allocating a raw block of memory.
            
        - `calloc()`: Allocating and zero-initializing a block.
            
        - `realloc()`: Resizing a previously allocated block.
            
        - `free()`: Why you **must** release memory.
            
    - Key Differences: `malloc` vs. `calloc`.
        
8. **Structures (`struct`)**
    
    - What is a `struct`? Creating your own custom, composite data types.
        
    - Accessing members: The `.` (dot) operator vs. the `->` (arrow) operator.
        
    - Using `typedef` for cleaner code.
        
    - Self-referential structures (the key to implementing linked lists and trees).
        

### **Part 3: Competitive Programming in C (Bridging from Python)**

9. **Arrays in Competitive Programming**
    
    - Static vs. Dynamically Sized Arrays (using `malloc`).
        
    - 2D Arrays (Matrices): Static and dynamic allocation techniques.
        
    - Passing arrays to functions correctly (as pointers).
        
10. **Simulating Python's `list` (Dynamic Array)**
    
    - Using a `struct` to manage a pointer, size, and capacity.
        
    - Implementing core functions: `create_list`, `append`, `get`, `set`, `free_list`.
        
11. **Implementing Core Data Structures in C**
    
    - **Linked Lists:** Using `struct` and `malloc` for nodes.
        
    - **Stacks & Queues:** Implementing them using both arrays and linked lists.
        
    - **Hash Maps (Conceptual):** Understanding the underlying structure (array of linked lists) and why it's complex to build from scratch in a contest.
        
    - **Priority Queues (Heaps):** Implementing the heap data structure using an array and heapify functions.
        
12. **Essential C Standard Library for CP**
    
    - `<stdio.h>`: For fast I/O.
        
    - `<stdlib.h>`: For memory management (`malloc`, etc.) and `qsort`.
        
    - `<string.h>`: For string manipulation (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`).
        
    - `<math.h>`: For math functions.
        
    - **Using `qsort()`:** C's powerful built-in sort function and how to use it with a custom comparator.
