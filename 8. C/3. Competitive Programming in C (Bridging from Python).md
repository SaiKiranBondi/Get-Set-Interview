### **9. Arrays in Competitive Programming**

While we've discussed arrays, using them effectively in a competitive programming (CP) setting, where input sizes can be large and variable, requires specific techniques.

#### **Static vs. Dynamically Sized Arrays (using `malloc`)**

This is the first major decision you make when solving a problem involving an array.

**Static Arrays**

- **Concept:** You declare an array with a fixed size that is known at compile time. In CP, this often means declaring an array large enough to handle the maximum possible input size given in the problem constraints.
    
- **Syntax:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    #define MAX_SIZE 100005 // A common practice
    
    int main() {
        int static_array[MAX_SIZE];
        // ... use the array ...
    }
    ```
    
- **Where it's stored:** On the **Stack** (if declared inside a function) or in a static data segment (if declared globally).
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Simple and fast to declare.
        
    - No need to `free()` memory.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - **Stack Overflow:** If `MAX_SIZE` is very large (e.g., 10^7), declaring it inside `main` will crash your program. For large static arrays, you should declare them **globally** (outside of `main`).
        
    - **Wasteful:** If N is small, you still allocate memory for the maximum possible N.
        

**Dynamic Arrays**

- **Concept:** You declare a pointer and then allocate exactly the amount of memory you need on the **Heap** using `malloc`. This is the most flexible approach and is essential when the input size `N` is read from the input itself.
    
- **Syntax:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    #include <stdlib.h> // For malloc and free
    
    int main() {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n); // Read the actual size needed
    
        // Declare a pointer, then allocate exactly n integers on the heap
        int *dynamic_array = (int*) malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    
        // IMPORTANT: Check if malloc succeeded
        if (dynamic_array == NULL) {
            // Handle memory allocation failure
            return 1;
        }
    
        // ... use the array ...
    
        free(dynamic_array); // You MUST free the memory when done.
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Flexible: Allocates exactly the memory needed.
        
    - No stack overflow risk for large arrays, as the heap is much larger.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Slightly more code (you must `malloc` and `free`).
        
    - Forgetting to `free` causes a memory leak.
        

**CP Strategy:** For simplicity, many competitive programmers use a large, globally declared static array. However, using dynamic allocation is a more robust and professional habit.

#### **2D Arrays (Matrices): Static and dynamic allocation**

Handling matrices requires careful memory management.

**Static 2D Arrays**

- **Concept:** A 2D array where both dimensions are fixed at compile time. The compiler allocates one single, contiguous block of memory.
    
- **Memory Layout:** Row-major order. The second row starts immediately after the first row ends in memory.
    
- **Syntax:** `int matrix[ROWS][COLS];`
    

Dynamic 2D Arrays

This is more complex. The standard method in C is to create an array of pointers, where each pointer then points to a dynamically allocated row.

- **Concept:** This creates a "jagged" array structure. The rows are allocated as independent blocks on the heap and are not guaranteed to be contiguous with each other.
    
- **Syntax & Allocation:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    int rows, cols;
    scanf("%d %d", &rows, &cols);
    
    // 1. Allocate an array of row pointers
    int **matrix = (int**) malloc(rows * sizeof(int*));
    
    // 2. Loop and allocate each row individually
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        matrix[i] = (int*) malloc(cols * sizeof(int));
    }
    
    // ... use matrix[i][j] as normal ...
    
    // 3. Free the memory in the reverse order of allocation
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        free(matrix[i]); // Free each row
    }
    free(matrix); // Free the array of pointers
    ```
    
- **Block Diagram: Dynamic 2D Array**
    
    ```
    Pointer 'matrix' (int**)
    +------+
    | addr | ---->  Heap Memory (Array of Pointers)
    +------+        +--------+
                    | addr_row0 | -----> [ Row 0 data ... ]
                    +--------+
                    | addr_row1 | -----> [ Row 1 data ... ]
                    +--------+
                    | addr_row2 | -----> [ Row 2 data ... ]
                    +--------+
    ```

#### **Passing arrays to functions correctly**

This is a common source of errors for beginners.

**Passing 1D Arrays**

- **Concept:** Remember that an array name decays to a pointer to its first element. You must also pass the size of the array as a separate argument because the function has no other way of knowing how long the array is.
    
- **Syntax (Function Prototype):**
    
    C
    
    ```
    // Both of these prototypes are identical and correct
    void process_array(int arr[], int size);
    void process_array(int *arr, int size);
    ```
    
- **Calling the function:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    int my_array[10];
    process_array(my_array, 10); // Pass the name directly
    ```
    

**Passing 2D Arrays**

- **For Static 2D Arrays:**
    
    - **Concept:** When passing a static 2D array, you can omit the first dimension's size, but you **must specify the second (and subsequent) dimension's size**. The compiler needs the column count to perform the pointer arithmetic `matrix[row][col]`, which translates to `*(base_address + row * COLS + col)`.
        
    - **Syntax (Function Prototype):**
        
        C
        
        ```
        #define COLS 5
        void process_static_matrix(int matrix[][COLS], int rows);
        ```
        
- **For Dynamic 2D Arrays (Array of Pointers):**
    
    - **Concept:** Here, you are not passing a single block of memory. You are passing a **pointer to a pointer (`int **`)**. The function doesn't need to know the dimensions at compile time, but you must pass them as arguments so it knows the bounds at runtime.
        
    - **Syntax (Function Prototype):**
        ```c
        void process_dynamic_matrix(int **matrix, int rows, int cols);
        ```

### **10. Simulating Python's `list` (Dynamic Array)**

### C Code for Dynamic List

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // Required for malloc, realloc, free

// The struct that defines our dynamic list.
// It bundles the data pointer, size, and capacity together.
typedef struct {
    int *data;      // Pointer to the block of integers on the heap
    int size;       // Number of elements currently stored
    int capacity;   // Total number of elements the block can hold
} DynamicList;

// --- Core Function Implementations ---

/**
 * @brief Initializes and creates a new, empty dynamic list.
 * @param initial_capacity The starting capacity of the list.
 * @return A pointer to the newly created DynamicList on the heap.
 */
DynamicList* create_list(int initial_capacity) {
    // Allocate memory for the main list structure itself
    DynamicList *list = (DynamicList*) malloc(sizeof(DynamicList));
    if (list == NULL) {
        return NULL;
    }

    list->size = 0;
    list->capacity = initial_capacity > 0 ? initial_capacity : 8; // Default to 8

    // Allocate memory on the heap for the actual array data
    list->data = (int*) malloc(list->capacity * sizeof(int));
    if (list->data == NULL) {
        free(list); // Clean up the struct memory before returning
        return NULL;
    }

    return list;
}

/**
 * @brief Appends an element to the end of the list, resizing if necessary.
 * @param list A pointer to the DynamicList to modify.
 * @param element The integer element to add.
 */
void append(DynamicList *list, int element) {
    // Check if the list is full.
    if (list->size == list->capacity) {
        // If full, double the capacity.
        int new_capacity = list->capacity * 2;
        int *new_data = (int*) realloc(list->data, new_capacity * sizeof(int));
        
        if (new_data == NULL) {
            printf("Error: Failed to reallocate memory for the list.\n");
            return;
        }
        
        list->data = new_data;
        list->capacity = new_capacity;
    }

    // Add the new element at the end.
    list->data[list->size] = element;
    list->size++;
}

/**
 * @brief Gets the element at a specific index.
 * @param list A pointer to the DynamicList.
 * @param index The index of the element to retrieve.
 * @return The element at the index, or an error value (e.g., -1) if out of bounds.
 */
int get(DynamicList *list, int index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < list->size) {
        return list->data[index];
    }
    printf("Error: Index %d is out of bounds.\n", index);
    return -1; // Return a sentinel value for error
}

/**
 * @brief Frees all memory associated with the dynamic list.
 * @param list A pointer to the DynamicList to free.
 */
void free_list(DynamicList *list) {
    if (list != NULL) {
        free(list->data);
        free(list);
    }
}
```

#### **Using a `struct` to manage a pointer, size, and capacity**

- **Concept:** To create a dynamic array, we need to track three key pieces of information. A `struct` is the perfect way to bundle them together.
    
    1. **A pointer to the data:** This will be a pointer (e.g., `int *data`) that points to a block of memory on the **heap** where the actual elements are stored.
        
    2. **Size:** An integer (`int size`) that tracks how many elements are **currently** in the list.
        
    3. **Capacity:** An integer (`int capacity`) that tracks how many elements the allocated block of memory on the heap can **currently hold**.
        
- **The Core Logic:** The `size` tells us where the next element should go (`data[size]`). The `capacity` tells us if we have enough room. The key is that `size` will always be less than or equal to `capacity`. When `size` becomes equal to `capacity`, our array is full, and we must resize it.
    
- **Syntax (The `struct` definition):**
    
    C
    
    ```
    typedef struct {
        int *data;      // Pointer to the block of integers on the heap
        int size;       // Number of elements currently stored
        int capacity;   // Total number of elements the block can hold
    } DynamicList;
    ```
    

#### **Implementing core functions**

- **`create_list()`**
    
    - **Purpose:** To initialize a new, empty list.
        
    - **Logic:**
        
        1. Allocate memory for the `DynamicList` struct itself.
            
        2. Set its initial `size` to `0`.
            
        3. Choose an initial `capacity` (e.g., 8 or 10 is a good start).
            
        4. Use `malloc` to allocate the initial block of memory on the heap for the `data` pointer.
            
        5. Return a pointer to the newly created `DynamicList` struct.
            
- **`append()`**
    
    - **Purpose:** To add an element to the end of the list, handling resizing automatically. This is the most important function.
        
    - **Logic:**
        
        1. **Check if full:** Compare `list->size` with `list->capacity`.
            
        2. If full:
            
            a. Double the capacity.
            
            b. Use realloc to resize the data block to the new capacity. realloc is perfect for this as it handles copying the old data for us.
            
            c. Update the list->capacity variable to the new value.
            
        3. **Add the element:** Place the new element at the end of the current data: `list->data[list->size] = new_element`.
            
        4. **Increment size:** `list->size++`.
            
- **`get(index)` & `set(index, value)`**
    
    - **Purpose:** To access or modify an element at a specific index.
        
    - **Logic:** These are straightforward. They first check if the `index` is valid (i.e., `0 <= index < list->size`). If it is, they simply perform the operation on the underlying `data` array.
        
- **`free_list()`**
    
    - **Purpose:** To clean up all the dynamic memory used by the list.
        
    - **Logic:** This is crucial to prevent memory leaks. You must free the memory in the reverse order of allocation.
        
        1. First, free the block of memory on the heap that `data` points to.
            
        2. Then, free the memory for the `DynamicList` struct itself.

### **11. Implementing Core Data Structures in C**

#### **Linked Lists: Using `struct` and `malloc` for nodes**

- Theoretical Explanation:
    
    The foundation of all linked data structures in C is the combination of a struct and dynamic memory allocation. We define a struct called a Node which is self-referential—it contains a pointer to another Node. This allows us to create chains of nodes. We use malloc to create these nodes on the heap, ensuring they persist between function calls. Each malloc for a new node must eventually be matched with a free call to prevent memory leaks.
    
- **Implementation Code:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    // 1. The Node Structure
    // A self-referential struct is the key to a linked list.
    // It holds data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.
    typedef struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node *next;
    } Node;
    
    // 2. Function to create a new node on the heap
    Node* create_node(int data) {
        // Allocate memory for one Node
        Node* new_node = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));
        if (new_node == NULL) {
            printf("Error: malloc failed!\n");
            return NULL;
        }
        // Initialize the node's fields
        new_node->data = data;
        new_node->next = NULL;
        return new_node;
    }
    
    // 3. Function to insert a new node at the beginning of the list
    // We pass a pointer-to-a-pointer to the head so we can modify the original head.
    void insert_at_head(Node** head_ref, int data) {
        Node* new_node = create_node(data);
        if (new_node == NULL) return;
    
        new_node->next = *head_ref; // The new node points to the old head
        *head_ref = new_node;       // The head pointer now points to the new node
    }
    
    // 4. Function to print the contents of the list
    void print_list(Node* head) {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current != NULL) {
            printf("%d -> ", current->data);
            current = current->next;
        }
        printf("NULL\n");
    }
    
    // 5. Function to free all nodes in the list to prevent memory leaks
    void free_list(Node* head) {
        Node* current = head;
        Node* next_node;
        while (current != NULL) {
            next_node = current->next; // Save the next node
            free(current);             // Free the current node
            current = next_node;       // Move to the next node
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Code Explanation:**
    
    1. **`Node` struct:** This defines our building block. `data` holds the value, and `next` is a pointer that links it to the next `Node`.
        
    2. **`create_node`:** This is our node factory. It uses `malloc` to request memory from the heap, initializes the node's values, and returns a pointer to this new memory block.
        
    3. **`insert_at_head`:** This function shows the core pointer manipulation. It takes a double pointer `head_ref` so it can change which node the original `head` variable points to. It sets the new node's `next` to the old head and then updates the head to be the new node.
        
    4. **`print_list`:** A standard traversal function that follows the `next` pointers until it reaches `NULL`.
        
    5. **`free_list`:** This is crucial for memory management. It iterates through the list, saving a pointer to the next node before freeing the current one, to avoid losing the rest of the list.

#### **Stacks & Queues: Implementations**

- **Theoretical Explanation:**
    
    - **Stack:** A stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) structure. Implementing it with a linked list is very natural. The `head` of the list serves as the `top` of the stack. `push` is an `insert_at_head` operation, and `pop` is a `delete_from_head` operation. Both are `O(1)`.
        
    - **Queue:** A queue is a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) structure. To achieve `O(1)` for both `enqueue` (add to back) and `dequeue` (remove from front), a linked list implementation needs pointers to both the `head` (front) and the `tail` (back).
        
- **Implementation Code:**
    ```
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    // We reuse the Node definition from the Linked List example
    typedef struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node *next;
    } Node;
    
    // --- STACK IMPLEMENTATION (using Linked List) ---
    
    typedef struct {
        Node* top; // The head of the list is the top of the stack
    } Stack;
    
    Stack* create_stack() {
        Stack* s = (Stack*) malloc(sizeof(Stack));
        s->top = NULL;
        return s;
    }
    
    void push(Stack* s, int data) {
        Node* new_node = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));
        new_node->data = data;
        new_node->next = s->top;
        s->top = new_node;
    }
    
    int pop(Stack* s) {
        if (s->top == NULL) {
            printf("Stack underflow!\n");
            return -1; // Error
        }
        Node* temp = s->top;
        int popped_data = temp->data;
        s->top = s->top->next;
        free(temp);
        return popped_data;
    }
    
    // --- QUEUE IMPLEMENTATION (using Linked List) ---
    
    typedef struct {
        Node* front; // Head of the list
        Node* rear;  // Tail of the list
    } Queue;
    
    Queue* create_queue() {
        Queue* q = (Queue*) malloc(sizeof(Queue));
        q->front = q->rear = NULL;
        return q;
    }
    
    void enqueue(Queue* q, int data) {
        Node* new_node = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));
        new_node->data = data;
        new_node->next = NULL;
    
        // If queue is empty, new node is both front and rear
        if (q->rear == NULL) {
            q->front = q->rear = new_node;
            return;
        }
    
        // Add the new node at the end and change rear
        q->rear->next = new_node;
        q->rear = new_node;
    }
    
    int dequeue(Queue* q) {
        if (q->front == NULL) {
            printf("Queue is empty!\n");
            return -1; // Error
        }
        Node* temp = q->front;
        int dequeued_data = temp->data;
        q->front = q->front->next;
    
        // If front becomes NULL, then change rear to NULL as well
        if (q->front == NULL) {
            q->rear = NULL;
        }
        free(temp);
        return dequeued_data;
    }
    ```
    
- **Code Explanation:**
    
    - **Stack:** The `Stack` struct just needs one pointer, `top`. `push` is equivalent to an `insert_at_head` operation on a linked list. `pop` removes the head node. Both are simple and `O(1)`.
        
    - **Queue:** The `Queue` struct needs two pointers, `front` and `rear`, to achieve `O(1)` performance. `enqueue` adds a new node after the current `rear` and updates the `rear` pointer. `dequeue` removes the `front` node (the head) and updates the `front` pointer. A special check is needed to handle the case where the queue becomes empty after a dequeue.

#### **Hash Maps (Conceptual) & Priority Queues (Heaps)**

- Theoretical Explanation:
    
    Implementing these from scratch in C during a contest is highly advanced. The key is to understand their structure.
    
    - **Hash Map:** An array of pointers (buckets), where each pointer is the head of a linked list to handle hash collisions.
        
    - **Priority Queue:** A complete binary tree represented in an array, where operations are managed by `heapify_up` and `heapify_down` functions to maintain the heap property.
        
- **Implementation Code (Structural Only):**
    
    C
    
    ```
    #include <string.h> // For strcmp, strcpy if using string keys
    
    // --- HASH MAP (Conceptual Structure) ---
    typedef struct HashNode {
        char* key;
        int value;
        struct HashNode* next;
    } HashNode;
    
    typedef struct {
        int num_buckets;
        HashNode** buckets; // An array of pointers to HashNodes
    } HashMap;
    
    // --- PRIORITY QUEUE (HEAP) (Structural) ---
    typedef struct {
        int* data;
        int size;
        int capacity;
    } PriorityQueue;
    ```
    
- **Code Explanation:**
    
    - **HashMap:** The code defines the two `struct`s needed. `HashNode` is for the linked list, and `HashMap` holds the array of buckets. The key is that `buckets` is an array of pointers (`HashNode**`).
        
    - **PriorityQueue:** This structure is identical to the `DynamicList` we built earlier. The complexity lies in the helper functions (`heapify_up`, `heapify_down`) that would operate on the `data` array to maintain the heap property.
---
### **Priority Queues (Heaps)**
  
A Priority Queue is an abstract data structure where each element has a "priority." When you extract an element, you always get the one with the highest priority. In a Min-Priority Queue, the element with the smallest value has the highest priority.
    
This is most efficiently implemented using a **Min-Heap**, which is a complete binary tree stored in an array. The key is that every parent is smaller than its children. We use two main helper functions to maintain this property:
    
**`heapify_up`:** After inserting a new element at the end, we "bubble it up" by repeatedly swapping it with its parent until the heap property is restored.
        
**`heapify_down`:** After removing the top element (the minimum), we move the last element to the top and "sink it down" by repeatedly swapping it with its smallest child until the heap property is restored.
        
- **Implementation Code:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// --- PRIORITY QUEUE (MIN-HEAP) IMPLEMENTATION ---

typedef struct {
	int* data;
	int size;
	int capacity;
} PriorityQueue;

// --- Helper Functions ---
void swap(int* a, int* b) {
	int temp = *a;
	*a = *b;
	*b = temp;
}

int parent(int i) { return (i - 1) / 2; }
int left_child(int i) { return 2 * i + 1; }
int right_child(int i) { return 2 * i + 2; }

// --- Core Logic Functions ---

// Bubbles an element up to its correct position. Used after insertion.
void heapify_up(PriorityQueue* pq, int index) {
	while (index > 0 && pq->data[index] < pq->data[parent(index)]) {
		swap(&pq->data[index], &pq->data[parent(index)]);
		index = parent(index);
	}
}

// Sinks an element down to its correct position. Used after extraction.
void heapify_down(PriorityQueue* pq, int index) {
	int min_index = index;
	int l = left_child(index);
	int r = right_child(index);

	if (l < pq->size && pq->data[l] < pq->data[min_index]) {
		min_index = l;
	}
	if (r < pq->size && pq->data[r] < pq->data[min_index]) {
		min_index = r;
	}

	if (index != min_index) {
		swap(&pq->data[index], &pq->data[min_index]);
		heapify_down(pq, min_index);
	}
}

// --- Public API Functions ---

PriorityQueue* create_priority_queue(int capacity) {
	PriorityQueue* pq = (PriorityQueue*) malloc(sizeof(PriorityQueue));
	pq->data = (int*) malloc(capacity * sizeof(int));
	pq->size = 0;
	pq->capacity = capacity;
	return pq;
}

void pq_insert(PriorityQueue* pq, int value) {
	if (pq->size == pq->capacity) {
		printf("Priority Queue is full!\n");
		return;
	}
	// Add the new element to the end
	pq->data[pq->size] = value;
	pq->size++;
	// Bubble it up to its correct place
	heapify_up(pq, pq->size - 1);
}

int pq_extract_min(PriorityQueue* pq) {
	if (pq->size == 0) {
		printf("Priority Queue is empty!\n");
		return -1; // Error
	}
	// The min element is always at the root
	int min_value = pq->data[0];

	// Move the last element to the root
	pq->data[0] = pq->data[pq->size - 1];
	pq->size--;

	// Sink the new root down to its correct place
	heapify_down(pq, 0);

	return min_value;
}

void free_priority_queue(PriorityQueue* pq) {
	if (pq != NULL) {
		free(pq->data);
		free(pq);
	}
}
```

### **Sample Question: Kth Largest Element in an Array**

This is a classic problem that perfectly demonstrates the power of a priority queue.

**Problem:** [LeetCode 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/) - Find the `k`th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the `k`th largest element in the sorted order, not the `k`th distinct element.

- Logic Explanation:
    
    We can solve this efficiently by maintaining a Min-Priority Queue of size k.
    
    1. Iterate through the numbers in the input array.
        
    2. For each number, add it to our Min-PQ.
        
    3. If the size of the Min-PQ ever exceeds `k`, it means we have `k+1` elements. The smallest of these (which is at the top of the Min-PQ) cannot possibly be the `k`th largest, so we remove it using `pq_extract_min`.
        
    4. After iterating through all the numbers, our Min-PQ will contain the `k` largest elements from the entire array.
        
    5. The `k`th largest element will be the smallest among these `k` elements, which is conveniently located at the very top of our Min-PQ.
        
- **Solution Code Using Our Priority Queue:**
```c
// This function assumes the Priority Queue implementation from above is available.

int findKthLargest(int* nums, int numsSize, int k) {
	// Create a Min-Priority Queue with a capacity of k
	PriorityQueue* pq = create_priority_queue(k);

	for (int i = 0; i < numsSize; i++) {
		if (pq->size < k) {
			// If the PQ is not yet full, just insert the number
			pq_insert(pq, nums[i]);
		} else if (nums[i] > pq->data[0]) {
			// If the PQ is full, and the current number is larger
			// than the smallest element in the PQ (the root)...

			// ...then the smallest element is not in the top k, so remove it...
			pq_extract_min(pq);
			// ...and insert the new, larger number.
			pq_insert(pq, nums[i]);
		}
	}

	// The root of the heap is now the kth largest element
	int result = pq->data[0];

	free_priority_queue(pq);
	return result;
}

// --- Main function to demonstrate the solution ---
int main() {
	int nums[] = {3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4};
	int k = 2;
	int numsSize = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);

	int kth_largest = findKthLargest(nums, numsSize, k);

	// The sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
	// The 2nd largest element is 5.
	printf("The %dnd largest element is: %d\n", k, kth_largest); // Output: The 2nd largest element is: 5

	int nums2[] = {3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6};
	k = 4;
	int numsSize2 = sizeof(nums2) / sizeof(nums2[0]);
	int kth_largest2 = findKthLargest(nums2, numsSize2, k);
	// The sorted array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6].
	// The 4th largest element is 4.
	printf("The %dth largest element is: %d\n", k, kth_largest2); // Output: The 4th largest element is: 4

	return 0;
}
```
    
- **Code Explanation:**
    
    1. **`findKthLargest`:** The function takes the input array, its size, and `k`.
        
    2. **`create_priority_queue(k)`:** We create a Min-PQ that will never hold more than `k` elements.
        
    3. **The Loop:** We iterate through the input `nums`.
        
        - The `if (pq->size < k)` block handles filling up the PQ initially until it contains `k` elements.
            
        - The `else if (nums[i] > pq->data[0])` block is the core logic. It compares the current number `nums[i]` with the smallest of the "top k" candidates we've seen so far (`pq->data[0]`). If our new number is larger, it deserves a spot in the top `k`, so we kick out the current smallest (`pq_extract_min`) and add the new one (`pq_insert`).
            
    4. **Result:** After the loop finishes, the PQ is a collection of the `k` largest numbers, and `pq->data[0]` is the smallest of them—precisely the `k`th largest element overall.
        
    5. **`free_priority_queue(pq)`:** We clean up the memory used by our data structure.

Of course. Let's cover the final topic from the C learning plan: the essential library functions you'll need for competitive programming.

---
### **12. Essential C Standard Library for CP**

- Theoretical Explanation:
    
    Unlike Python, which has a vast number of built-in functions and data structures, C provides a smaller, more fundamental standard library. To be effective in competitive programming, you need to know which "header files" to #include to get access to critical tools for tasks like sorting, memory management, and string manipulation. Mastering these is non-negotiable for solving problems efficiently in C.
    

#### **`<stdio.h>`: For Fast I/O**

- **Concept:** Stands for **St**an**d**ard **I**nput/**O**utput. This is the most fundamental header file. It provides the functions for reading from the console (`stdin`) and writing to the console (`stdout`).
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - `printf()`: For printing formatted output.
        
    - `scanf()`: For reading formatted input. In competitive programming, `scanf` is generally much faster than C++'s `cin`, making it a preferred choice for large inputs.
        

#### **`<stdlib.h>`: For Memory and Sorting**

- **Concept:** Stands for **St**an**d**ard **Lib**rary. This is a general-purpose utility header. Its most important features for competitive programming are dynamic memory allocation and C's built-in sorting function.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()`: The essential tools for managing memory on the heap, as we've discussed.
        
    - `qsort()`: The "quick sort" function. This is C's primary tool for sorting arrays. It's powerful but requires you to provide your own comparison logic.
        
    - `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of an integer.
        

#### **`<string.h>`: For String Manipulation**

- **Concept:** Provides functions for working with C-style strings (which are null-terminated character arrays). You should almost always use these functions instead of trying to manipulate strings manually with loops, as they are highly optimized.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - `strlen(str)`: Returns the length of a string (excluding the `\0` null terminator). Python equivalent: `len(str)`.
        
    - `strcpy(dest, src)`: **Cop**ies the contents of the `src` string into the `dest` string.
        
    - `strcmp(str1, str2)`: **Comp**ares two strings lexicographically. It returns `0` if they are equal, a negative value if `str1` comes before `str2`, and a positive value if `str1` comes after `str2`.
        

#### **`<math.h>`: For Math Functions**

- **Concept:** Provides common mathematical functions. Remember to link the math library during compilation if needed (e.g., `gcc my_program.c -o my_program -lm`).
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - `sqrt(x)`: Square root.
        
    - `pow(base, exp)`: Power function (`base` raised to the power of `exp`).
        
    - `ceil(x)`, `floor(x)`: Ceiling and floor functions.
        
    - `fabs(x)`: Absolute value for floating-point numbers.

### **Using `qsort()`: C's Powerful Sorting Function**

- Theoretical Explanation:
    
    The qsort function is C's generic sorting algorithm. It can sort an array of any data type (integers, floats, structs, etc.). To achieve this flexibility, it uses void* (generic pointers) and requires you, the programmer, to provide a comparator function. This comparator function is the logic that tells qsort how to compare any two elements in your array.
    
    The signature for qsort is:
    
    void qsort(void* base, size_t num_elements, size_t element_size, int (*comparator)(const void*, const void*));
    
    The most important part is the `comparator`. It's a function you write that must:
    
    1. Accept two `const void*` arguments. These are generic pointers to two elements from the array that need to be compared.
        
    2. Return an `int`:
        
        - `< 0` if the first element should come before the second.
            
        - `0` if the elements are equal.
            
        - `> 0` if the first element should come after the second.
            
- **Implementation Code:**
    
    C
    
    ```
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    // This is the custom comparator function for sorting integers in ascending order.
    int compare_integers(const void* a, const void* b) {
        // 1. Cast the generic void pointers back to the correct type (int*).
        int int_a = *( (const int*) a );
        int int_b = *( (const int*) b );
    
        // 2. Perform the comparison and return the result.
        if (int_a < int_b) {
            return -1; // a should come before b
        } else if (int_a > int_b) {
            return 1;  // a should come after b
        } else {
            return 0;  // They are equal
        }
    
        // A common shorthand for the above if-else block is:
        // return (int_a - int_b);
    }
    
    // A comparator for sorting integers in descending order.
    int compare_integers_desc(const void* a, const void* b) {
        int int_a = *( (const int*) a );
        int int_b = *( (const int*) b );
        // Just flip the logic
        return (int_b - int_a);
    }
    
    
    int main() {
        int my_array[] = {40, 10, 100, 90, 20, 25};
        int num_elements = sizeof(my_array) / sizeof(my_array[0]);
    
        printf("Original array: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            printf("%d ", my_array[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    
        // Call qsort to sort in ascending order
        qsort(my_array, num_elements, sizeof(int), compare_integers);
    
        printf("Sorted array (ascending): ");
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            printf("%d ", my_array[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    
        // Call qsort again to sort in descending order
        qsort(my_array, num_elements, sizeof(int), compare_integers_desc);
    
        printf("Sorted array (descending): ");
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; i++) {
            printf("%d ", my_array[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    
- **Code Explanation:**
    
    1. **`compare_integers` function:** This is the heart of the example.
        
        - It receives two generic `void*` pointers, `a` and `b`.
            
        - `*( (const int*) a )`: This is the crucial casting step. We first tell the compiler "treat `a` as a pointer to a constant integer" (`(const int*) a`). Then, we use the `*` to dereference that pointer to get the actual integer value.
            
        - The function then returns `-1`, `1`, or `0` based on the comparison, which `qsort` uses to decide whether to swap the elements.
            
    2. **`main` function:**
        
        - We define a simple integer array.
            
        - We call `qsort`, passing it:
            
            - `my_array`: The array to be sorted (acts as a pointer to the start).
                
            - `num_elements`: The number of items in the array.
                
            - `sizeof(int)`: The size of a single element.
                
            - `compare_integers`: A pointer to our custom comparison function. `qsort` will call this function internally whenever it needs to compare two elements.
                
        - We then print the array to show that it has been sorted in-place.
            
        - We call it a second time with a different comparator to show how easily the sort order can be changed.
