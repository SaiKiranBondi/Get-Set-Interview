A **WLAN** is a local area network that uses radio waves to connect devices, commonly known as Wi-Fi. The standards that govern how Wi-Fi works are defined by the **IEEE 802.11** family of protocols.

#### 802.11 Standards

The 802.11 standards have evolved over time, with each new version offering significant improvements in speed, efficiency, and capacity. Here are the key standards you should know:

- **802.11b (Wi-Fi 1)**: One of the first widely adopted standards. It operates in the crowded 2.4 GHz band with a maximum data rate of 11 Mbps.
- **802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)**: The successor to 802.11b, it also operates in the 2.4 GHz band but increased the maximum data rate to 54 Mbps.
- **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**: A major leap forward that introduced **MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output)**, which uses multiple antennas to increase data throughput. It can operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, with speeds up to 600 Mbps.
- **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**: This standard operates exclusively in the cleaner 5 GHz band. It introduced wider channels and improved **MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO)**, allowing an access point to transmit data to multiple clients simultaneously.
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E)**: This is the current mainstream standard and is a key area of focus. Its main goal is not just higher peak speeds, but better **efficiency and performance in dense environments** like airports and stadiums.
    - **Key Technology - OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access)**: This is the most significant feature. It allows an Access Point to divide a wireless channel into smaller sub-channels. This means the AP can talk to multiple clients at the exact same time within a single transmission.
    - **Analogy**: Think of OFDMA like a delivery truck that can carry packages for multiple different houses and drop them all off in a single trip, instead of making a separate trip for each house.
    - **Wi-Fi 6E**: This is an extension of Wi-Fi 6 that allows operation in the brand new **6 GHz band**, which provides much more bandwidth and less interference than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

#### Summary Table of Standards

|Standard|Wi-Fi Name|Frequency Band|Max Data Rate|Key Feature|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|802.11b|Wi-Fi 1|2.4 GHz|11 Mbps|Early adoption|
|802.11g|Wi-Fi 3|2.4 GHz|54 Mbps|Increased speed|
|802.11n|Wi-Fi 4|2.4 / 5 GHz|600 Mbps|MIMO|
|802.11ac|Wi-Fi 5|5 GHz|~1.3 Gbps+|MU-MIMO|
|802.11ax|Wi-Fi 6/6E|2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz|~9.6 Gbps+|**OFDMA**, Efficiency|

### *WLAN Security Protocols*

Securing a wireless network is critical because its signals travel through the air, making them easy to intercept. We need to ensure that only authorized users can connect (**authentication**) and that the data they send is unreadable to eavesdroppers (**encryption**).

The modern security standard is **WPA3** (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3), which builds upon its predecessor, WPA2. It operates in two main modes: Personal and Enterprise.

---

### WPA3-Personal vs. WPA3-Enterprise

- **Personal Mode**: This is what you use at home. It uses a **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)**â€”a single password that everyone uses to connect to the network.
- **Enterprise Mode**: This is used in corporate environments. It doesn't use a single shared password. Instead, each user has a unique set of credentials (like a username and password) that are verified by a central server. This mode uses the **IEEE 802.1X** framework.

### IEEE 802.1X (Port-Based Network Access Control)

**802.1X** is a framework that provides powerful, user-based authentication. It involves three key components:
1. **Supplicant**: The client device trying to connect (e.g., your laptop or phone).
2. **Authenticator**: The device that controls network access. In a WLAN, this is the **Access Point (AP)**. The AP acts as a middleman.
3. **Authentication Server**: The central server that makes the final decision. It checks the supplicant's credentials and tells the authenticator whether to grant or deny access. This is almost always a **RADIUS** server.

### The Four-Way Handshake

The **Four-Way Handshake** is a critical process that happens _after_ successful authentication (either with a PSK or 802.1X). Its purpose is **not** to authenticate the user, but to securely generate and exchange the fresh encryption keys that will be used for that specific session.

This process ensures that even if two devices on the same network use the same password (PSK), their actual data is encrypted with unique, temporary keys.

- **Key Generated**: The main outcome of the handshake is the creation of a **Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)**. This key is unique to the client and the session and is used to encrypt all data sent between the client and the Access Point.

### *Access Point (AP) Boot Methods*

When an Access Point powers on, it needs to get an IP address and find its controller to download its configuration and become operational. Here is the typical boot-up sequence:

1. **Power On**: The AP is powered on, often via **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**, which provides both power and data over a single Ethernet cable.
2. **Get an IP Address**: The AP sends a **DHCP Discover** message to get an IP address, just like any other network device. The DHCP server provides the AP with an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
3. **Find the Controller**: This is the critical step. The AP must find its management controller (like a XYZ Company SmartZone or Unleashed Master). It tries several methods in order:
    - **Static Configuration**: The AP checks if a controller's IP address has been manually configured.
    - **DHCP Options**: The AP checks the DHCP offer it received for a special "Option 43," which can contain the controller's IP address.
    - **DNS Lookup**: The AP performs a DNS query for a specific default hostname (e.g., `zonedirector.yourdomain.com`). The DNS server can be configured to resolve this name to the controller's IP address.
4. **Connect and Configure**: Once the AP finds and connects to the controller, it downloads its configuration, firmware updates, and joins the network. The AP is now operational and can begin serving wireless clients.

### Captive Portal Flow

A **Captive Portal** is a web page that a newly connected user is redirected to before they are granted full network access. It's commonly used in public Wi-Fi networks (hotels, airports, coffee shops) to require users to authenticate, accept terms of service, or make a payment.

Here is the typical user workflow:

1. **User Connects to Wi-Fi**: The user selects the public Wi-Fi network (SSID) and connects. At this point, the user has Layer 2 connectivity but no broader network access.
2. **HTTP Request and Interception**: The user opens a web browser and tries to visit a website (e.g., `http://www.google.com`).
3. **Redirection**: The Access Point or network controller intercepts this initial HTTP request. Instead of letting it go to the internet, it responds with an HTTP redirect, sending the user's browser to the captive portal login page.
4. **User Authentication**: The user is now presented with the captive portal page. They must perform an action, such as:
    - Entering a username and password.
    - Clicking an "Accept Terms" button.
    - Entering a voucher code.
5. **Access Granted**: Once the user successfully authenticates, the controller updates its records to grant that user's device full access to the network. The user can now browse the internet freely.
