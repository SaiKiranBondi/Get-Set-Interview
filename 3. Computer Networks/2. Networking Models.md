Networking models provide a framework for understanding how different networking protocols and technologies work together to enable communication. They break down the complex process into smaller, more manageable layers.

#### The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

The OSI Model is a **conceptual framework** that standardizes the functions of a network into seven logical layers. Think of it as a blueprint for how data is sent from an application on one computer to an application on another.

As data is sent, it travels **down** the layers, and as it is received, it travels **up** the layers. At each layer (on the sending side), a header is addedâ€”a process called **encapsulation**.

### Layer 7: Application Layer

- **Function**: This is the layer closest to the end-user. It provides network services directly to user applications. It's what the user, and the application, interacts with.
- **Analogy**: The app on your phone or computer (e.g., your web browser, email client).
- **Protocols**: **HTTP**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, **DNS**.
- **Data Unit**: Data.

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for data translation, formatting, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data sent from one system can be read by another system.
- **Analogy**: A universal translator that converts data into a standardized format.
- **Protocols**: **SSL/TLS** (for encryption), **JPEG**, **ASCII**.
- **Data Unit**: Data.

### Layer 5: Session Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for opening, managing, and closing sessions (connections) between two devices. It controls the dialogue between computers.
- **Analogy**: A phone call operator who establishes the call, keeps the line open, and disconnects it when the conversation is over.
- **Protocols**: **NetBIOS**, **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call).
- **Data Unit**: Data.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer

- **Function**: This layer provides reliable (or unreliable) end-to-end data delivery between hosts. It handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction.
- **Analogy**: A postal service. You can choose a reliable, tracked delivery (**TCP**) or a fast, simple postcard delivery (**UDP**).
- **Protocols**: **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol), **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Data Unit**: Segment (TCP), Datagram (UDP).

### Layer 3: Network Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for **logical addressing** (IP addresses) and **routing**. It determines the best path to move data packets from the source to the destination across different networks.
- **Analogy**: A GPS system that calculates the best route for a road trip through multiple cities.
- **Protocols/Devices**: **IP** (Internet Protocol), **ICMP**; **Routers**.
- **Data Unit**: Packet.

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

- **Function**: This layer handles **physical addressing** (MAC addresses) and defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium. It's responsible for error-free transfer of data frames between two nodes on the same network.
- **Analogy**: The local street address and traffic rules within a single neighborhood.
- **Protocols/Devices**: **Ethernet**, **MAC addresses**; **Switches**, **Bridges**.
- **Data Unit**: Frame.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of raw bits (1s and 0s) over the network medium. It defines the specifications for cables, connectors, voltages, and radio frequencies.
- **Analogy**: The physical road, the copper in the cable, or the radio waves in the air.
- **Protocols/Devices**: **Ethernet cables**, **Fiber optics**, **Wi-Fi**; **Hubs**.
- **Data Unit**: Bits.

### OSI Model Layer Stack

This diagram shows the seven layers in order, from top to bottom, along with the name of the data unit (PDU) at each layer.

### Data Encapsulation and Flow

This diagram shows how data from an application on a sending device is "encapsulated" with a header at each layer as it moves down the stack. It is then transmitted as bits over the physical medium and "de-encapsulated" (headers are removed) as it moves up the stack on the receiving device.

## The TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a more practical framework that is the foundation of the modern internet. Unlike the seven-layer OSI model, the TCP/IP model is typically described with four layers. It combines some of the OSI model's layers and is named after its two most important protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

---

Here are the four layers of the TCP/IP Model:

#### Layer 4: Application Layer

- **Function**: This layer combines the responsibilities of the OSI model's Application, Presentation, and Session layers. It provides protocols that applications use to exchange data.
- **Protocols**: **HTTP**, **DNS**, **FTP**, **SMTP**.

#### Layer 3: Transport Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between hosts, ensuring data is delivered reliably or unreliably depending on the application's needs. This layer directly corresponds to the OSI Transport Layer.
- **Protocols**: **TCP**, **UDP**.

#### Layer 2: Internet Layer

- **Function**: This layer's job is to move packets from source to destination across different networks. It handles logical addressing and routing. This layer corresponds to the OSI Network Layer.
- **Protocols**: **IP**, **ICMP**.

#### Layer 1: Network Access Layer

- **Function**: This layer combines the OSI model's Data Link and Physical layers. It is responsible for transmitting data over the physical network medium within the same network.
- **Protocols**: **Ethernet**, **Wi-Fi**, MAC addresses.

|Basis for Comparison|OSI Model|TCP/IP Model|
|---|---|---|
|**Number of Layers**|It has **7 layers**.|It has **4 layers**.|
|**Approach**|A **vertical** approach. It is a theoretical, reference model.|A **horizontal** approach. It is a practical, implementation model.|
|**Protocol Dependency**|Protocol independent; it provides a generic standard.|Protocol dependent; it is built around the TCP and IP protocols.|
|**Layer Combination**|Has separate Application, Presentation, and Session layers.|Combines Application, Presentation, and Session layers into a single **Application Layer**.|
|**Network & Data Link**|Has separate Network and Data Link layers.|Combines Data Link and Physical layers into a single **Network Access Layer**.|
|**Usage**|Used primarily for teaching, standardization, and as a reference guide.|It is the model used for the actual implementation of the modern internet.|
