Networking models provide a framework for understanding how different networking protocols and technologies work together to enable communication. They break down the complex process into smaller, more manageable layers.

#### The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

The OSI Model is a **conceptual framework** that standardizes the functions of a network into seven logical layers. Think of it as a blueprint for how data is sent from an application on one computer to an application on another.

As data is sent, it travels **down** the layers, and as it is received, it travels **up** the layers. At each layer (on the sending side), a header is addedâ€”a process called **encapsulation**.

### Layer 7: Application Layer

- **Function**: This is the layer closest to the end-user. It provides network services directly to user applications. It's what the user, and the application, interacts with.
    
- **Analogy**: The app on your phone or computer (e.g., your web browser, email client).
    
- **Protocols**: **HTTP**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, **DNS**.
    
- **Data Unit**: Data.
    

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for data translation, formatting, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data sent from one system can be read by another system.
    
- **Analogy**: A universal translator that converts data into a standardized format.
    
- **Protocols**: **SSL/TLS** (for encryption), **JPEG**, **ASCII**.
    
- **Data Unit**: Data.
    

### Layer 5: Session Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for opening, managing, and closing sessions (connections) between two devices. It controls the dialogue between computers.
    
- **Analogy**: A phone call operator who establishes the call, keeps the line open, and disconnects it when the conversation is over.
    
- **Protocols**: **NetBIOS**, **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call).
    
- **Data Unit**: Data.
    

### Layer 4: Transport Layer

- **Function**: This layer provides reliable (or unreliable) end-to-end data delivery between hosts. It handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction.
    
- **Analogy**: A postal service. You can choose a reliable, tracked delivery (**TCP**) or a fast, simple postcard delivery (**UDP**).
    
- **Protocols**: **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol), **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol).
    
- **Data Unit**: Segment (TCP), Datagram (UDP).
    

### Layer 3: Network Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for **logical addressing** (IP addresses) and **routing**. It determines the best path to move data packets from the source to the destination across different networks.
    
- **Analogy**: A GPS system that calculates the best route for a road trip through multiple cities.
    
- **Protocols/Devices**: **IP** (Internet Protocol), **ICMP**; **Routers**.
    
- **Data Unit**: Packet.
    

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

- **Function**: This layer handles **physical addressing** (MAC addresses) and defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium. It's responsible for error-free transfer of data frames between two nodes on the same network.
    
- **Analogy**: The local street address and traffic rules within a single neighborhood.
    
- **Protocols/Devices**: **Ethernet**, **MAC addresses**; **Switches**, **Bridges**.
    
- **Data Unit**: Frame.
    

### Layer 1: Physical Layer

- **Function**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of raw bits (1s and 0s) over the network medium. It defines the specifications for cables, connectors, voltages, and radio frequencies.
    
- **Analogy**: The physical road, the copper in the cable, or the radio waves in the air.
    
- **Protocols/Devices**: **Ethernet cables**, **Fiber optics**, **Wi-Fi**; **Hubs**.
    
- **Data Unit**: Bits.

Block diagrams that illustrate the OSI Model layers and the flow of data through them.

### OSI Model Layer Stack

This diagram shows the seven layers in order, from top to bottom, along with the name of the data unit (PDU) at each layer.

### Data Encapsulation and Flow

This diagram shows how data from an application on a sending device is "encapsulated" with a header at each layer as it moves down the stack. It is then transmitted as bits over the physical medium and "de-encapsulated" (headers are removed) as it moves up the stack on the receiving device.
