This layer provides protocols that network applications use to exchange data. We'll start with **DHCP**, the protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses.

#### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**DHCP** is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. When you connect a device to a network, DHCP automatically assigns it an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information. This eliminates the need for a network administrator to configure each device manually.

##### The DORA Process

DHCP works using a four-step process known as **DORA**:

1. **Discover**: When a new client device joins the network, it sends a **DHCP Discover** message as a broadcast, asking, "Is there a DHCP server available?"
2. **Offer**: Any DHCP server on the network that receives the discover message can reply with a **DHCP Offer** message. This message is a unicast to the client and contains a potential IP address and other configuration details.
3. **Request**: The client receives one or more offers and chooses one. It then sends a **DHCP Request** message as a broadcast, saying, "I would like to accept the offer from server X." The broadcast informs other DHCP servers that their offers were not accepted.
4. **Acknowledge**: The selected DHCP server sends a final **DHCP Acknowledge** message to the client, confirming the IP address lease and providing any remaining configuration details. The client can now use the assigned IP address.

### *DNS (Domain Name System)*

**DNS** is the protocol that translates human-readable **domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into machine-readable **IP addresses** (like `172.217.167.78`).

**Analogy**: DNS is often called the "phonebook of the Internet." It's much easier for people to remember a name than a long string of numbers. ðŸ“–

#### How a DNS Query Works

When you type a domain name into your browser, a hierarchical query process happens in the background to find the corresponding IP address.

1. **Local Cache**: Your computer first checks its own local DNS cache to see if it has recently looked up this domain.
2. **Recursive DNS Server**: If not found locally, the query is sent to a **Recursive DNS Server** (usually operated by your ISP). This server's job is to find the answer for you.
3. **Root Server**: The recursive server asks a **Root Server**. The root server replies, "I don't know the IP for `www.google.com`, but I know where the servers for the `.com` domain are."
4. **TLD Server**: The recursive server then asks a **`.com` Top-Level Domain (TLD) Server**. The TLD server replies, "I don't know the IP for `www.google.com`, but I know the authoritative name server for the `google.com` domain."
5. **Authoritative Name Server**: Finally, the recursive server asks the **Authoritative Name Server** for `google.com`. This server holds the actual DNS records and replies with the correct IP address.
6. **Final Reply**: The recursive server sends the IP address back to your computer and caches the result to speed up future requests.

#### Common DNS Record Types

- **A Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME (Canonical Name)**: An alias that points one domain name to another.
- **MX (Mail Exchanger)**: Specifies the mail server responsible for a domain.

### *FTP (File Transfer Protocol)*

**FTP** is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It is one of the oldest application layer protocols and relies on **TCP** for reliable data transfer.

#### Dual Connections

The most unique characteristic of FTP is that it uses **two separate TCP connections** to function:

1. **Control Connection (Port 21)**: The client first establishes a connection to the server on port 21. This connection is used for sending commands (like `ls` to list files, `get` to download, `put` to upload) and receiving responses from the server. This connection remains open for the entire session.
2. **Data Connection (Port 20 in Active Mode)**: Whenever a file is actually transferred or a directory listing is requested, FTP opens a _separate_ connection just for that data transfer. Once the transfer is complete, this data connection is closed.

#### Active vs. Passive Mode

This describes how the data connection is established.

- **Active Mode**: The client tells the server which port it is listening on. The **server then initiates** the data connection back to the client. This often fails when the client is behind a firewall that blocks incoming connections.
- **Passive Mode (More Common)**: The client asks the server for a port to connect to. The server provides a random port number, and the **client then initiates** the data connection to the server. This mode is more firewall-friendly.

#### Security

Standard FTP is **insecure**. Both credentials (username and password) and file data are sent in plain text. For secure file transfers, modern alternatives are used:

- **FTPS**: FTP with SSL/TLS encryption.
- **SFTP**: SSH File Transfer Protocol, which is a completely different protocol that runs over an SSH connection.

---
### *SSH (Secure Shell)*

**SSH** is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over an unsecured network. It is the standard for remote administration and file transfer. SSH operates on TCP port 22 by default.

Its primary uses are:

- **Secure Remote Login**: To access and manage a remote server's command line securely. It is the secure replacement for the outdated **Telnet** protocol.
- **Secure File Transfer**: Using protocols like **SFTP** or the `scp` command.
- **Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**: To securely tunnel other network protocols.

---
#### How SSH Works

SSH uses a client-server model and provides security through strong encryption and robust authentication methods.

- **Encryption**: The entire SSH session is encrypted, including the initial login, all commands you type, and their output. This prevents anyone on the network from eavesdropping on your session.
- **Authentication**: SSH verifies the identity of the user connecting. There are two primary methods:
    1. **Password Authentication**: The user provides a username and password. This is simple but less secure.
    2. **Public Key Authentication (More Secure)**: This method uses a pair of cryptographic keysâ€”a private key and a public key.
        - The user generates a key pair and copies their **public key** to the server. The **private key** is kept secret on the user's own computer.
        - When connecting, the server uses the public key to issue a challenge to the client.
        - The client uses its private key to correctly answer the challenge.
        - If the answer is correct, the server authenticates the user without a password ever being sent over the network.
