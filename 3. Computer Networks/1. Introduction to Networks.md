#### What is a Network?

At its core, a **computer network** is a collection of two or more interconnected computers and other hardware devices (like printers and servers) that can communicate with each other and share resources. The primary goals are:

- **Resource Sharing**: Sharing files, printers, scanners, and storage devices.
- **Communication**: Enabling email, video conferencing, instant messaging, etc.
- **Information Access**: Connecting to the internet to access web pages, databases, and other remote information.

### Network Devices

These are the fundamental hardware components that connect computers and direct traffic within a network.

#### Hub

A hub is the most basic networking device used to connect multiple devices in a Local Area Network (LAN).

- **OSI Layer**: Layer 1 (Physical Layer).
- **Mechanism**: When a data packet (frame) arrives at one port, the hub simply regenerates the signal and broadcasts it out to **every other port** on the device. It has no intelligence to determine the intended destination.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - Creates a single **collision domain**: If two devices try to send data at the same time, the signals collide, and the data is corrupted. All devices must share the bandwidth.
    - Operates in **half-duplex** mode, meaning a device cannot send and receive data simultaneously.
    - Hubs are now considered obsolete and have been replaced by switches.

#### Bridge

A bridge is used to connect two separate network segments into a single, larger network.

- **OSI Layer**: Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
- **Mechanism**: A bridge is more intelligent than a hub. It inspects the **MAC address** (the hardware address) of incoming frames. It builds a table of which MAC addresses are on which network segment.
    - If the destination device is on a different segment, the bridge **forwards** the frame.
    - If the destination device is on the same segment as the source, the bridge **filters** (drops) the frame, preventing unnecessary traffic from crossing over.
    
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - Divides a larger network into two separate collision domains.
    - It was the precursor to the modern network switch.

#### Switch

A switch is a modern, intelligent device that connects multiple devices on a LAN. It's essentially a multi-port bridge.

- **OSI Layer**: Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
- **Mechanism**: A switch maintains a **MAC address table** (or CAM table) that maps the MAC address of each connected device to a specific physical port on the switch. When a frame arrives, the switch looks up the destination MAC address in its table and forwards the frame **only to the port** connected to the destination device. This creates a temporary, dedicated connection.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - Each port is its own collision domain, dramatically reducing network congestion.
    - Operates in **full-duplex** mode, allowing devices to send and receive data simultaneously.

#### Router

A router is a device that connects two or more different networks together (e.g., connecting your home network to the internet).

- **OSI Layer**: Layer 3 (Network Layer).
- **Mechanism**: A router makes forwarding decisions based on **IP addresses**, not MAC addresses. It uses a **routing table** to determine the best path to send a packet towards its final destination network.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - It separates **broadcast domains**. A broadcast message sent on one network will not be forwarded by the router to another network.
    - It is the device that allows communication across different logical networks (e.g., from a device on a 192.168.1.0 network to a server on the public internet).

### Key Takeaways

- **Hub vs. Switch**: The main difference is that a **hub broadcasts** every packet to every device, creating network congestion and collisions. A **switch is intelligent** and sends a packet only to the intended destination device, dramatically improving efficiency.
    
- **Switch vs. Router**: The main difference is the layer they operate on and the type of address they use.
    
    - A **switch** works at Layer 2 using **MAC addresses** to connect devices _within the same network_.
        
    - A **router** works at Layer 3 using **IP addresses** to connect _different networks_ together and route traffic between them. A router is what separates your local network from the internet.

### *Network Topologies*

**Network topology** is the architectural layout of a network. It defines how the different nodes (devices like computers and printers) are connected to each other and how data flows between them.

---
#### Bus Topology

In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single, shared communication line called a **bus** or **backbone**. To prevent signals from bouncing back and causing interference, both ends of the bus are terminated with a resistor.

**How it works:** When one device wants to send data, it broadcasts the data onto the main bus. All other devices on the bus can see the data, but only the intended recipient accepts and processes it.

- **Analogy:** Think of a single hallway in an office. To talk to a colleague, you have to speak out loud in the hallway. Everyone can hear you, but only your colleague responds. If two people talk at once, their messages get garbled (a collision).


**Diagram**

- **Advantage**: It's very cheap and easy to set up, requiring minimal cable.
- **Disadvantage**: It's not scalable and is prone to failure. If the main bus cable breaks, the entire network becomes unusable. Performance also degrades significantly as more devices are added, due to increased traffic and collisions. This topology is now considered obsolete.

---
#### Ring Topology

In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular fashion, with each device linked to exactly two others. Data travels from node to node, typically in one direction.

**How it works:** A "token" (a small data frame) is passed around the ring. A device can only send data when it has possession of the token. This token-passing mechanism prevents data collisions.

- **Analogy:** Imagine a round-table meeting where only the person holding the microphone (the token) is allowed to speak. They speak, then pass the microphone to the next person.

**Diagram**

- **Advantage**: It's more orderly than a bus network, with fewer collisions under heavy load.
- **Disadvantage**: A single point of failure. If one device or a section of the cable fails, the entire ring is broken. It is also difficult to add or remove devices, as it requires breaking the loop. This topology is also largely legacy.

---
#### Star Topology

In a star topology, all devices are individually connected to a central device, such as a **switch** or a hub. This is the most widely used topology for modern Local Area Networks (LANs).

**How it works:** When a device wants to send data to another, it sends the data to the central switch. The switch then intelligently forwards the data only to the intended destination port.

- **Analogy:** Think of an airport hub. To get from one city to another, you often fly to a central hub airport first, which then directs you to your final destination.

**Diagram**

![[mermaid-diagram-2025-07-17-184546.png]]

- **Advantage**: It's very reliable and easy to manage. If one device or its cable fails, only that device is affected; the rest of the network remains operational. Adding or removing devices is simple.
- **Disadvantage**: There is a single point of failure. If the central switch fails, the entire network goes down.

---

#### Mesh Topology

In a mesh topology, devices are interconnected with many redundant paths. In a **full mesh**, every device is directly connected to every other device. In a **partial mesh**, only some devices are fully interconnected.

**How it works:** Data can be sent between devices via multiple paths. If one link fails, the network can automatically reroute the traffic through an alternate path.

- **Analogy:** Think of the flight routes between major international cities. There are often many different ways to get from one city to another, providing high reliability.

**Diagram**

![[mermaid-diagram-2025-07-17-184642.png]]

- **Advantage**: It is extremely fault-tolerant and robust.
- **Disadvantage**: The amount of cabling and the number of connections required make it very expensive and complex to install and manage. It is typically used for critical backbone connections on the internet or in other high-stakes Wide Area Networks (WANs).

### Network Types

Networks are also classified by their geographical size and scope.

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: This is a network contained within a small geographical area, such as your home, a single office building, or a school campus. You privately own and manage the networking equipment (switches, routers, cables). LANs use high-speed technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: This network spans a very large geographical area, such as across cities, states, or even countries. A WAN connects multiple LANs together. You do not own the WAN infrastructure; instead, companies lease lines from telecommunication providers. The **Internet** is the world's largest WAN.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A MAN is a network that is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. It typically covers a city or a large campus. It might be used to connect all the government buildings within a city, for example.
