This layer is responsible for reliable data transfer between two nodes on the same physical network. We'll start with its most fundamental concept: **MAC addresses**.

### *MAC Addresses*

A **MAC (Media Access Control) address** is a unique, permanent hardware identifier assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) by its manufacturer. It's used to identify devices on a local network.
- **Other Names**: It's often called a physical address, hardware address, or burned-in address.
- **Purpose**: While an IP address identifies a device's location on a network (like a home address), a MAC address identifies the device itself (like a unique serial number).

##### Format of a MAC Address

A MAC address is a 48-bit (6-byte) address, typically written in hexadecimal format and separated by colons or hyphens.

**Example**: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

It is split into two parts:

1. **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**: The first 24 bits (3 bytes). This part is assigned to a specific manufacturer by the IEEE. In our example, `00:1A:2B` might be assigned to Intel.
2. **NIC Specific**: The last 24 bits (3 bytes). The manufacturer assigns this part, ensuring that every NIC they produce has a unique address.

##### How MAC Addresses are Used

- **Local Delivery**: **Switches**, which operate at Layer 2, use MAC addresses to make intelligent forwarding decisions. A switch builds a MAC address table that maps which device is connected to which port. When a frame arrives for a specific MAC address, the switch sends it only to the correct port, rather than broadcasting it everywhere.
- **Broadcast Address**: The special MAC address `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` is the broadcast address. Frames sent to this address are delivered to every device on the local network segment. This is used by protocols like **ARP** to discover information.

### *Ethernet Frames*

An **Ethernet frame** is the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) for Layer 2. Think of it as the envelope that carries the Layer 3 IP packet. It wraps the packet with the necessary addressing and error-checking information for transmission across a local network.

The structure of the frame is critical because it's how switches and NICs know where the data is coming from, where it's going, what's inside, and whether it's been corrupted.

#### Structure of an Ethernet II Frame

This is the most common Ethernet frame format used today.

Here's what each field does:

- **Preamble & SFD (Start Frame Delimiter)**: These first 8 bytes work together to help the receiving device synchronize its clock. The Preamble is a sequence of alternating 1s and 0s, and the SFD marks the end of the preamble and the beginning of the actual frame data.
- **Destination MAC Address** (6 bytes): This is the hardware address of the device that is meant to receive the frame.
- **Source MAC Address** (6 bytes): This is the hardware address of the device that sent the frame.
- **EtherType (Type)** (2 bytes): This very important field indicates which Layer 3 protocol is encapsulated in the payload. The receiving device uses this code to know which program to hand the payload off to.
    - Example: A value of `0x0800` means the payload is an **IPv4 packet**.
    - Example: A value of `0x0806` means the payload is an **ARP packet**.
- **Payload / Data** (46-1500 bytes): This is the actual data being transported—the IP packet from Layer 3. The payload must be at least 46 bytes long.
- **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)** (4 bytes): This field is used for **error detection**. The sending device performs a calculation (a Cyclic Redundancy Check or CRC) on the frame and puts the result in the FCS. The receiving device performs the same calculation. If the results don't match, the frame is considered corrupted and is discarded.

### *VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)*

A **VLAN** is a logical grouping of devices that allows you to segment a physical network into separate, isolated virtual networks. Devices within a VLAN can communicate with each other as if they were on the same physical switch, regardless of their actual location.
#### The Problem VLANs Solve
In a standard network, all devices connected to a switch are in the same **broadcast domain**. This means if one computer sends a broadcast message, the switch forwards it to every other device on the network. As the network grows, this can lead to:

- **Performance Degradation**: Excessive broadcast traffic consumes network bandwidth.
- **Security Risks**: Any device can see broadcast traffic from any other device.

#### How VLANs Work

VLANs solve this by dividing a single physical switch into multiple virtual switches, creating separate broadcast domains.

**Without VLANs: One Large Broadcast Domain**

_A broadcast from the Sales PC goes to everyone, including the Engineering PCs._

**With VLANs: Two Separate Broadcast Domains**

![[mermaid-diagram-2025-07-17-214131.png]]

_Now, a broadcast from the Sales PC _only_ goes to other devices in VLAN 10._

---

This logical separation is achieved through **VLAN tagging**.

- **VLAN Tagging (IEEE 802.1Q)**: When a frame is sent between switches, a special 4-byte **tag** is inserted into the Ethernet frame. This tag contains a **VLAN ID (VID)**, which identifies the VLAN the frame belongs to.
- **Access Ports**: An access port is a switch port that belongs to a **single VLAN**. It connects to end devices like computers and printers. The switch adds the VLAN tag when a frame enters an access port and removes it when the frame leaves.
- **Trunk Ports**: A trunk port is a switch port that can carry traffic for **multiple VLANs** at the same time. These are used to connect switches to other switches or to routers. Frames on a trunk port keep their VLAN tags.

#### Inter-VLAN Routing

**Trunk Port Diagram**

Devices on different VLANs cannot communicate directly. To allow communication between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20, you need a Layer 3 device—a **router** or a **Layer 3 switch**—to route traffic between them.
