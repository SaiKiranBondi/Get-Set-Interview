The **Transport Layer** provides logical communication between applications running on different hosts. While the Network Layer gets packets from one host to another, the Transport Layer is responsible for getting the data to the correct _application_ on that host.

It does this using **port numbers**. For example, web traffic (HTTP) uses port 80, and secure web traffic (HTTPS) uses port 443.

The two most important protocols at this layer are TCP and UDP. We'll start with TCP.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is a **connection-oriented** and **reliable** transport protocol. Think of it as a registered mail service with tracking and delivery confirmation.

- **Connection-Oriented**: A connection must be established between the two devices _before_ any data is sent. This is done via the **Three-Way Handshake**.
- **Reliable**: TCP guarantees that data will be delivered completely, in order, and without errors. It achieves this using:
    - **Sequence Numbers**: To reorder data that arrives out of order.
    - **Acknowledgments (ACKs)**: The receiver sends acknowledgments for data it receives. If the sender doesn't receive an ACK, it **retransmits** the data.
    - **Flow Control**: Prevents a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.
    - **Congestion Control**: Helps prevent the network itself from becoming congested.

#### The Three-Way Handshake

This is the process TCP uses to establish a connection.

1. **SYN**: The client sends a TCP segment with the **SYN** (Synchronize) flag set to the server. This is like saying, "I'd like to start a conversation."  
2. **SYN-ACK**: The server receives the request and, if it can accept the connection, replies with a segment that has both the **SYN** and **ACK** (Acknowledge) flags set. This is like saying, "Okay, I'm ready for a conversation, and I acknowledge your request."
3. **ACK**: The client receives the SYN-ACK and sends a final **ACK** segment back to the server. This is like saying, "Great, I acknowledge your readiness. Let's talk."

The connection is now established.

### *UDP (User Datagram Protocol)*

**UDP** is the second major protocol at the Transport Layer. In contrast to TCP, UDP is a **connectionless** and **unreliable** protocol.

- **Connectionless**: No handshake or connection is established before sending data. UDP just sends the data packets (called datagrams) and hopes for the best.
- **Unreliable**: UDP provides no guarantee that the data will be delivered, that it will arrive in the correct order, or that it is free of errors. There are no acknowledgments or retransmissions. This is often called **"best-effort" delivery**.

#### When to Use UDP

You might wonder why anyone would use an "unreliable" protocol. The primary advantage of UDP is its **speed and low overhead**. Because it skips all the complexity of TCP (handshakes, sequencing, ACKs), it's very fast.

UDP is preferred for applications where speed is more important than perfect reliability. üöÄ

- **Real-time Applications**: **Video streaming**, **Voice over IP (VoIP)**, and **online gaming**. In these cases, it's better to miss a single frame or a tiny bit of audio than to wait for a retransmission, which would cause noticeable lag or jitter.
- **Query-Response Protocols**: **DNS** and **DHCP**. These involve a small request and a small reply. The overhead of setting up a TCP connection is unnecessary. If a request is lost, the application can simply send it again.

**Analogy**: If TCP is like a registered mail service with tracking, UDP is like sending a simple postcard. It's fast and cheap, but there's no guarantee it will arrive. üìÆ

### TCP vs. UDP Comparison

![[Pasted image 20250717232127.png]]

|Feature|TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)|UDP (User Datagram Protocol)|
|---|---|---|
|**Connection Type**|**Connection-Oriented** (establishes a connection via a three-way handshake before sending data).|**Connectionless** (sends data without establishing a connection).|
|**Reliability**|**Reliable** (guarantees data delivery using acknowledgments and retransmissions).|**Unreliable** (best-effort delivery; no guarantee of delivery, no retransmissions).|
|**Ordering**|**Ordered** (guarantees that data packets are delivered in the sequence they were sent).|**Unordered** (data packets may arrive out of order).|
|**Speed**|**Slower**, due to the overhead of reliability checks, acknowledgments, and flow control.|**Faster**, due to its simplicity and low overhead.|
|**Header Size**|Larger header (**20 bytes**).|Very small header (**8 bytes**).|
|**Use Cases**|Web Browse (HTTP/S), email (SMTP), file transfers (FTP) ‚Äî where accuracy is critical.|Video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, DNS ‚Äî where speed is critical.|
|**Analogy**|Registered Mail üìÆ (with tracking and delivery confirmation).|Postcard ‚úâÔ∏è (fast and simple, no confirmation).|

## **The Bigger Picture**

### The Role of the Transport Layer (Layer 4)

Think of it this way: the **Network Layer** (Layer 3) gets a letter delivered to the correct **building address** (the IP address). Its job is done once the letter arrives at the building.

The **Transport Layer** (Layer 4) is like the mailroom inside that building. It looks at the name or apartment number on the letter (the **port number**) and makes sure it gets to the specific **person or application** that it's intended for.

#### What it Connects

The Transport Layer connection is between a specific **application process** on the source host and a specific **application process** on the destination host.

- **Network Layer Connection**: Host-to-Host (e.g., from your computer's IP to Google's server IP).
    
- **Transport Layer Connection**: Process-to-Process (e.g., from your web browser process to Google's web server process).
    

This is managed using **port numbers**. When your browser (the client) wants to connect to a web server, it sends data to the server's IP address and specifies **destination port 80** (for HTTP). The server's Transport Layer sees that port 80 is for the web server application and delivers the data there.

#### What it Sends, Receives, and Unpacks

- **What it Sends (Sending Host)**:
    
    1. The Transport Layer receives a large stream of data from an application (like a web page request).
    2. It breaks this data into smaller, manageable chunks.
    3. It adds a **TCP or UDP header** to each chunk. This header contains the source and destination port numbers. This new data unit is now called a **Segment** (for TCP) or **Datagram** (for UDP).
    4. It then hands these segments down to the Network Layer to be sent.
    
- **What it Receives and Unpacks (Receiving Host)**:
    
    1. The Transport Layer receives segments from the Network Layer.
    2. It reads the TCP or UDP header to identify the destination port number (e.g., port 80).
    3. It **unpacks** the data by removing the TCP/UDP header.
    4. It reassembles the small chunks back into the original data stream.
    5. Finally, it delivers that complete data stream to the correct application that is "listening" on that port (e.g., the web server).
