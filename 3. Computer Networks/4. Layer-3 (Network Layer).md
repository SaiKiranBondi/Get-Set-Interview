This layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing packets across different networks. We'll start with the most fundamental concept here: **IP Addressing**.

#### IP Addressing

An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a logical address that uniquely identifies a device on a network. Unlike a physical MAC address that is fixed to the hardware, an IP address can change depending on the network the device is connected to. Its primary purpose is to allow devices to communicate with each other across different networks.

The most common version is **IPv4**, which is a 32-bit address broken into four 8-bit numbers (called octets), written in dotted-decimal notation.

**Example**: `192.168.1.10`

An IP address has two parts:

1. **Network Portion**: Identifies the specific network the device is on. All devices on the same network share the same network portion.
2. **Host Portion**: Identifies the specific device on that network.

The **subnet mask** is used to separate the two portions.

**IP Address & Subnet Mask Example**

- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.10`
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`

By applying the subnet mask, we can determine:

- **Network Address**: `192.168.1.0` (This identifies the network itself)
- **Host Address**: `.10` (This identifies the specific device on that network)

**Routers** use the network portion of the IP address to forward packets to the correct destination network. Once the packet arrives at the correct network, switches can use the MAC address to deliver it to the final host.

### *ARP*

An ARP, or Address Resolution Protocol, is used to find the MAC address of a device from a known IP address.
### How ARP Works

ARP is the protocol used to map a Layer 3 address (IP address) to a Layer 2 address (MAC address). When a device wants to send a packet to another device on the same local network, it knows the destination IP address, but it needs the destination MAC address to create the Layer 2 Ethernet frame.

The process works as follows:

1. **ARP Request**: The sending device (Host A) checks its ARP cache to see if it already has the MAC address for the destination IP address. If it doesn't, it sends a broadcast message to the entire local network called an "ARP Request." The request essentially asks, "Who has the IP address `192.168.1.20`? Please tell me your MAC address."
2. **ARP Reply**: Every device on the local network receives and processes the ARP request. However, only the device that owns that IP address (Host B) will respond. Host B sends a unicast message back to Host A called an "ARP Reply." The reply says, "I have the IP address `192.168.1.20`, and my MAC address is `BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB`."
3. **ARP Cache**: Host A receives the reply and stores the IP-to-MAC address mapping in its ARP cache. It can now create the Ethernet frame with the correct destination MAC address and send its packet directly to Host B. The ARP cache is used to avoid repeating this broadcast process for every packet.

### ARP Process

1. **ARP Request (Broadcast)**: Host A sends a broadcast message to every device on the LAN, asking for the owner of the IP address `192.168.1.20`.
2. **ARP Reply (Unicast)**: Host B, the owner of that IP address, replies directly to Host A with its MAC address.

### *ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)*

**ICMP** is a network layer protocol used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with another IP address. It is not used to exchange data between end systems but rather to provide feedback about the communication itself.

The two most common uses for ICMP are for error reporting and network diagnostics.

#### Common ICMP Messages

- **Destination Unreachable**: Sent by a router when it cannot find a path to the destination IP address.
- **Time Exceeded**: Sent by a router when a packet's Time-To-Live (TTL) counter reaches zero. This prevents packets from looping endlessly on the network.    
- **Echo Request & Echo Reply**: These are the messages used by the popular `ping` utility.

#### How `ping` Works

The **`ping`** command is a diagnostic tool that uses ICMP to test the reachability of a host on a network.

1. When you type `ping 8.8.8.8`, your computer (the source) sends an **ICMP Echo Request** packet to the destination IP `8.8.8.8`.
2. If the destination host is reachable, it responds by sending an **ICMP Echo Reply** packet back to your computer.
3. Your computer measures the time it took to receive the reply (the round-trip time) and displays it. If it doesn't get a reply, it indicates a connectivity problem.

### *Routing Protocols*

While routers make decisions using a **routing table**, that table has to be populated with information. **Routing protocols** are the dynamic methods routers use to share information with each other to automatically learn about remote networks and build their routing tables.

The primary goal of a routing protocol is to determine the best path for a packet to take to its destination. They are generally categorized into two main types:

- **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)**: Used for routing _within_ a single network or autonomous system (e.g., inside a single company's network).
- **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**: Used for routing _between_ different autonomous systems. This is the protocol that runs the internet.

#### OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

- **Type**: IGP
- **Protocol Family**: Link-State
- **How it Works**: Each router running OSPF builds a complete map of the entire network's topology. Using this map, it independently calculates the shortest (best) path to every destination using the Dijkstra algorithm.
- **Use Case**: Very popular in large enterprise and corporate networks. Because it's an "open" standard, it can be used on equipment from various vendors (like Cisco, Juniper, etc.).

---

#### EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

- **Type**: IGP
- **Protocol Family**: Advanced Distance-Vector
- **How it Works**: Routers share their routing tables with their immediate neighbors. It's known for its simplicity and fast convergence time, meaning it can find a new best path very quickly if the network changes.
- **Use Case**: Primarily used in networks with Cisco equipment, as it was originally a Cisco proprietary protocol.

---

#### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

- **Type**: EGP
- **Protocol Family**: Path-Vector
- **How it Works**: This is the protocol that makes the internet work. BGP is used to exchange routing information between the huge networks (Autonomous Systems) that comprise the internet (e.g., between Comcast, Google, and AT&T). Unlike IGPs that focus on the fastest path, BGP makes routing decisions based on complex administrative policies and path attributes.
- **Use Case**: It is the standard and only EGP used for routing on the global internet.
