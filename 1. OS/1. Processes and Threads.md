In a modern operating system, a **process** is a program that is currently being executed, while **threads** are the individual tasks that make up that process.

### What is a Process?

A process is more than just the program code. It is an active entity that includes:

- **The program code** (also called the text section).
- **A program counter**: This indicates the next instruction to be executed.
- **A set of registers**: These hold current activity, such as instruction arguments and local variables.
- **A stack**: This contains temporary data like function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.
- **A data section**: This holds global variables.
- **A heap**: This is memory that is dynamically allocated during runtime.

Think of a process as an isolated container for a running application. The operating system ensures that one process cannot interfere with the memory or resources of another process.

#### Process Memory Layout

Here is a simplified block diagram of how a single process is laid out in memory:

```
+------------------+
|      Stack       |  <-- Grows downwards
|       ...        |
|                  |
+------------------+
|       ...        |
|       Heap       |  <-- Grows upwards
+------------------+
|  Uninitialized   |
|       Data       |  (Global and static variables)
+------------------+
|   Initialized    |
|       Data       |
+------------------+
|       Text       |  (Program Code)
+------------------+
```

#### Process States

A process goes through different states during its lifecycle. Understanding these state transitions is a common interview question.

1. **New**: The process is being created.
2. **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. It has everything it needs to run.
3. **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
4. **Waiting (or Blocked)**: The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O operation to complete or a signal to be received).
5. **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

### What is a Thread?

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, all running at the same time (or concurrently).

Think of a word processor application:

- One thread could be checking your spelling and grammar.
- Another thread could be responding to your keyboard input.
- A third thread could be auto-saving your document in the background.

All these threads belong to the _same process_ (the word processor). This means they **share** the process's resources:

- Code Section (Text)
- Data Section
- Heap
- Files and other OS resources

However, each thread gets its **own**:

- **Stack**
- **Set of Registers**
- **Program Counter**

#### Single-Threaded vs. Multi-Threaded Process

This diagram shows the difference in memory structure:

### Key Differences: Process vs. Thread (Crucial for Interviews)

|Feature|Process|Thread|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory**|Each process has its own separate memory space. They are isolated.|Threads share the memory space of their parent process.|
|**Creation**|Process creation is "heavyweight." It requires more time and resources.|Thread creation is "lightweight" and much faster.|
|**Communication**|Communication between processes (Inter-Process Communication) is complex and requires explicit OS support (e.g., pipes, shared memory).|Threads can communicate easily by sharing data directly (e.g., global variables). This is faster but requires careful synchronization.|
|**Context Switching**|Switching between processes is slow as the OS must save and load the entire process state, including memory maps.|Switching between threads of the same process is fast. The OS only needs to save and load the thread's private stack and registers. The shared memory map remains the same.|

### Code Examples

#### Process Creation in C (using `fork()`)

The `fork()` system call is used in Linux/Unix to create a new process. The new process (child) is an exact copy of the calling process (parent).

C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork(); // Create a new process

    if (pid < 0) {
        // Fork failed
        fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // This is the child process
        printf("I am the child process! My PID is %d\n", getpid());
        // The child can execute a different program using exec()
        execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);
    } else {
        // This is the parent process
        printf("I am the parent process! My PID is %d. My child's PID is %d\n", getpid(), pid);
        wait(NULL); // Parent waits for the child to finish
        printf("Child Complete\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `fork()` returns 0 in the child process and the child's PID in the parent process.
- `execlp()` replaces the child process's memory space with a new program (`ls -l` in this case). The process itself doesn't change, but its code, data, and stack are replaced. This demonstrates how new programs are run.

The child process ID is **not** the same as the parent process ID. Every process running in the operating system has its own unique Process ID (PID).

Here is a breakdown of why they are different, based on how the `fork()` system call works:

1. **The `fork()` Return Value**: The `fork()` function is called once, but it returns twice ‚Äì once in the parent process and once in the newly created child process.
    - **In the Parent Process**: It returns the PID of the new child process. This will be a positive number.
    - **In the Child Process**: It returns `0`.
2. **The `getpid()` Function**: This function always returns the PID of the process that is currently executing it.

Let's trace the execution of your code:

- `pid_t pid = fork();` is executed. A new child process is created. Let's imagine the parent's PID is **5021** and the new child's PID is **5022**.
    
- **In the Parent Process (PID 5021):**
    
    - The `fork()` call returns the child's PID, so the `pid` variable is set to **5022**.
    - The condition `if (pid == 0)` is **false** (since 5022 is not 0).
    - The `else` block is executed.
    - `printf("I am the parent process! My PID is %d. My child's PID is %d\n", getpid(), pid);`
        - `getpid()` returns the parent's own PID: **5021**.
        - `pid` holds the child's PID: **5022**.
        - Output will be: `I am the parent process! My PID is 5021. My child's PID is 5022`
- **In the Child Process (PID 5022):**
    
    - The `fork()` call returns `0`, so the `pid` variable is set to **0**.
    - The condition `if (pid == 0)` is **true**.
    - The `if` block is executed.
    - `printf("I am the child process! My PID is %d\n", getpid());`
        - `getpid()` returns the child's own PID: **5022**.
        - Output will be: `I am the child process! My PID is 5022`

Therefore, the parent and child are two distinct processes, each with its own unique ID.
#### Thread Creation in C (using pthreads)

pthreads is a standard interface for creating and managing threads in C.

C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// This function will be executed by the new thread
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    printf("Hello from the new thread!\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread_id; // Variable to store thread ID

    printf("Before creating thread.\n");

    // Create a new thread that will execute 'thread_function'
    if (pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, thread_function, NULL) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error creating thread\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Wait for the created thread to finish its execution
    pthread_join(thread_id, NULL);

    printf("After thread has finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `pthread_create()` creates a new thread within the current process. It takes the function the thread should run as an argument.
- `pthread_join()` makes the main thread (the one running `main()`) wait until the new thread has completed. This is important for ensuring the program doesn't exit before the thread has a chance to run.

# *Zombie and Child Processes*

### Zombie Process üßü

A **zombie process** is a process that has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table. This happens because its parent process has not yet "reaped" it by reading its exit status. They are also known as "defunct" processes.

Zombies don't consume CPU resources, but they do occupy a slot in the process table, which is a finite resource.

#### How a Zombie is Created

1. A child process is created using `fork()`.
2. The child process finishes its execution and calls `exit()`. It is now terminated.
3. The parent process continues running but does not call the `wait()` system call to get the child's exit status.
4. The terminated child process now enters the "zombie" state.

**Block Diagram**

![[Pasted image 20250717032719.png]]```

#### How Zombies are Handled

- **The `wait()` System Call**: The primary way to handle a zombie is for the parent process to execute the `wait()` or `waitpid()` system call. This call reads the child's exit status and allows the kernel to remove the child's entry from the process table.
- **The `init` Process**: If a parent process terminates _without_ calling `wait()`, its zombie children are "inherited" by the `init` process (PID 1). The `init` process periodically calls `wait()` and cleans up any zombies it has adopted.

---

### Orphan Process üßç

An **orphan process** is a process whose parent process has finished or terminated, but the child process is still running.

#### How an Orphan is Created

1. A parent process creates a child process.
2. The parent process terminates _before_ the child process does.
3. The running child process is now an "orphan."

**Block Diagram**

![[Pasted image 20250717032928.png]]
#### How Orphans are Handled

The Linux kernel handles orphans immediately and automatically.

- **Adoption by `init`**: As soon as a process becomes an orphan, the kernel sets its new parent to be the `init` process (PID 1). On modern systems, this is typically `systemd`.
- **`init` as the New Parent**: The `init` process is now responsible for this child. When the orphan process eventually terminates, `init` will call `wait()` on it, read its exit status, and ensure it is cleaned up properly, preventing it from becoming a zombie.
