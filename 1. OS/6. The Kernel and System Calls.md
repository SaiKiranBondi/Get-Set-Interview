The kernel is the central, core component of an operating system. It has complete control over everything in the system and acts as the main bridge between hardware and software.

- **Core Responsibilities**: The kernel manages the system's resources, including:
    - **Process Management**: Scheduling which process runs next.
    - **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory for processes.
    - **Device Management**: Handling I/O requests from devices like disks, printers, and network cards.
- **Analogy**: Think of the kernel as the engine of a car. You, the driver, use a steering wheel and pedals (the application interface), but it's the engine that does the core work of managing power and making the car move.

### User Mode vs. Kernel Mode

To protect the kernel and system resources from being corrupted by user applications (which could be buggy or malicious), the CPU operates in two distinct modes. This separation is a fundamental concept for system stability and security.

- **User Mode**: The mode in which standard user applications run.
    - **Restrictions**: Code running in user mode has restricted access to hardware. It cannot directly access devices, manage memory for other processes, or halt the entire system. It operates in a protected, isolated memory space.
- **Kernel Mode** (also called Supervisor or Privileged Mode): The mode in which the kernel runs.
    - **Privileges**: Code running in kernel mode has unrestricted, privileged access to all hardware and memory. It can execute any CPU instruction and manage all system resources.

The only way for a user application to perform a privileged action is to ask the kernel to do it on its behalf. This request is made via a **system call**.

**Mode Switching Block Diagram**

This diagram shows the boundary between the two modes and how a system call crosses it.

### System Calls

A **system call** is the programmatic interface that a user application uses to request a service from the operating system's kernel. It's the bridge that allows a program running in user mode to access the privileged functions of the kernel.

### How a System Call Works
1. A user application needs a service, like reading from a file. It calls a standard library function (e.g., `read()` in C).
2. This library function is a wrapper. It places the required parameters (like the file handle and a buffer to store the data) into specific CPU registers and puts a unique number identifying the system call (`read` in this case) into another designated register.
3. The library function then executes a special `TRAP` instruction.
4. This `TRAP` instruction causes the CPU to switch from **user mode** to **kernel mode** and transfers control to a predefined location in the kernelâ€”the system call handler.
5. The system call handler reads the system call number, looks up the corresponding kernel function in a table, and executes it.
6. The kernel's `read` function performs the operation (e.g., gets data from a disk controller).
7. Once complete, the kernel places a return value in a register, switches the CPU back to **user mode**, and returns control to the user application, right after the `TRAP` instruction.
#### Common Examples of System Calls in Linux

These are essential to know, as Linux fundamentals are a key area for your interview.

- **Process Control**:
    - `fork()`: Create a new child process.
    - `exec()`: Replace the current process's memory space with a new program.
    - `wait()`: Wait for a child process to terminate.
- **File Management**:
    - `open()`: Open a file for reading, writing, or both.
    - `read()`: Read data from a file.
    - `write()`: Write data to a file.
    - `close()`: Close an open file.
- **Information Maintenance**:
    - `getpid()`: Get the current process's ID.
    - `time()`: Get the current system time.
