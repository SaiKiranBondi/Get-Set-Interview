### Core Operating System Concepts

1. **Processes and Threads**
    - Process Definition and States
    - Process Control Block (PCB)
    - Threads vs. Processes
    - Context Switching
2. **CPU Scheduling**
    - Scheduling Goals (Throughput, Turnaround Time, etc.)
    - Preemptive vs. Non-preemptive Scheduling
    - Scheduling Algorithms:
        - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
        - Shortest Job First (SJF)
        - Priority Scheduling
        - Round Robin
3. **Synchronization**
    - The Critical Section Problem
    - Race Conditions
    - Synchronization Mechanisms:
        - Mutexes
        - Semaphores
        - Monitors
4. **Deadlocks**
    - Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
    - Deadlock Prevention
    - Deadlock Avoidance (e.g., Banker's Algorithm)
    - Deadlock Detection and Recovery
5. **Memory Management**
    - Physical vs. Logical Address Space
    - Paging and Segmentation
    - Virtual Memory
    - Demand Paging and Page Faults
    - Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal)
6. **The Kernel and System Calls**
    - User Mode vs. Kernel Mode
    - Role of the Kernel
    - System Call Interface and Mechanism
7. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
    - Pipes
    - Message Queues
    - Shared Memory

### Linux OS Fundamentals

1. **File System**
    - File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
    - Inodes
    - File Permissions and Ownership (`chmod`, `chown`)
2. **Core Commands**
    - Process Management: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `nice`
    - File Management: `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `find`, `ln`
    - Text Processing: `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `cat`, `less`
    - Networking: `ip`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`, `traceroute`
3. **Shell Scripting**
    - Variables and Control Structures (loops, conditionals)
    - Command-line arguments
    - Basic Automation
4. **Boot Process**
    - BIOS/UEFI
    - Bootloader (GRUB)
    - Kernel Initialization
    - Init Process (e.g., systemd)
5. **Key System Calls**
    - Process Creation: `fork()`, `exec()`
    - File I/O: `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`
