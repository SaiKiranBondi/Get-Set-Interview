CPU scheduling is the process by which the operating system decides which of the processes in the "Ready" queue should be allocated the CPU for execution. In a multiprogramming system, the OS needs an efficient way to switch the CPU among multiple processes to keep it busy and to give users a responsive experience.

---
#### Goals of CPU Scheduling

The primary goals are to optimize the system's performance. An ideal scheduler will aim to:

- **Maximize CPU Utilization**: Keep the CPU as busy as possible.
- **Maximize Throughput**: The number of processes completed per unit of time.
- **Minimize Turnaround Time**: The total time taken for a process to complete, from its arrival to its termination.
- **Minimize Waiting Time**: The total time a process spends waiting in the Ready queue.
- **Minimize Response Time**: The time from when a request is submitted until the first response is produced (crucial for interactive systems).

---
#### Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling

This is a fundamental concept and a very common interview question.

1. **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**:
    - Once the CPU has been allocated to a process, it keeps the CPU until it either terminates or switches to the waiting state (e.g., for an I/O operation).
    - **Analogy**: A person at a billing counter who cannot be asked to leave until their entire transaction is complete.
    - **Simple and predictable**, but can lead to poor response times if a long process is holding the CPU.
2. **Preemptive Scheduling**:
    - The CPU can be taken away ("preempted") from a running process and allocated to another, higher-priority process. This happens when a new process arrives or an interrupt occurs.
    - **Analogy**: An emergency patient arriving at a hospital who is seen by the doctor immediately, even if the doctor was with another patient with a less critical issue.
    - **More complex**, but provides better response times and fairness. It is the basis for most modern operating systems.

### Scheduling Algorithms

Here are the classic algorithms you need to master. We will use a consistent set of processes to see how each algorithm performs.

**Sample Processes:**

|Process|Arrival Time|Burst Time (CPU Time needed)|
|---|---|---|
|P1|0|7 ms|
|P2|2|4 ms|
|P3|4|1 ms|
|P4|5|4 ms|

#### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

- **How it works**: The simplest scheduling algorithm. The process that requests the CPU first gets it first. It is implemented using a simple FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue.
- **Type**: Non-Preemptive.

**Example Execution (Gantt Chart):**

A Gantt chart is a timeline diagram that illustrates the schedule.

```
P1 arrives at time 0. P2 at 2, P3 at 4, P4 at 5.

|      P1 (7ms)      |   P2 (4ms)   | P3 (1ms) |  P4 (4ms)  |
0                    7              11         12           16
```

- **Analysis**:
    - **Simple to implement.**
    - **Major Drawback (Convoy Effect)**: If a very long process (P1) arrives before shorter ones (P2, P3, P4), the short processes have to wait a long time, even if they are ready. This leads to high average waiting time.

---
#### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)

- **How it works**: The scheduler selects the process with the smallest CPU burst time. This is provably optimal in terms of minimizing the average waiting time.
- **Type**: Can be both Non-Preemptive and Preemptive.

**A) Non-Preemptive SJF**

Once a process starts, it will run to completion.

**Example Execution (Gantt Chart):**

1. At time 0, only P1 is available. It starts running.
2. P1 runs to completion at time 7.
3. At time 7, processes P2, P3, and P4 have all arrived. Their burst times are P2=4, P3=1, P4=4.
4. P3 has the shortest burst time (1ms), so it runs next.
5. After P3, P2 and P4 are left. They have the same burst time, so we can use FCFS as a tie-breaker. P2 runs, then P4.

```
|      P1 (7ms)      | P3 (1ms) |   P2 (4ms)   |  P4 (4ms)  |
0                    7          8              12           16
```

**B) Preemptive SJF (also known as Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)**

If a new process arrives with a CPU burst length shorter than the _remaining_ time of the current process, the current process is preempted.

**Example Execution (Gantt Chart):**

1. At time 0, P1 arrives and starts running. Burst = 7.
2. At time 2, P2 arrives (Burst=4). The _remaining_ time for P1 is 7-2=5. Since P2's burst (4) is less than P1's remaining time (5), P1 is **preempted**, and P2 starts running.
3. At time 4, P3 arrives (Burst=1). The _remaining_ time for P2 is 4-2=2. Since P3's burst (1) is less than P2's remaining time (2), P2 is **preempted**, and P3 starts running.
4. At time 5, P3 is still running. P4 arrives (Burst=4). The remaining time for P3 is 0. P3 completes at time 5.
5. Now at time 5, the ready queue has: P1 (Remaining=5), P2 (Remaining=2), P4 (Burst=4). P2 has the shortest remaining time, so it runs next.    
6. P2 runs to completion (time 5+2=7).
7. Now at time 7, we have P1 (Remaining=5) and P4 (Burst=4). P4 runs next.
8. P4 runs to completion (time 7+4=11).
9. Finally, P1 runs to completion (time 11+5=16).

```
| P1(2) | P2(2) |P3(1)|  P2(2)  |    P4(4)     |      P1(5)       |
0       2       4      5         7              11                 16
```

- **Analysis**:
    - SRTF gives the minimum average waiting time.
    - **Major Drawback (Starvation)**: A process with a very long burst time might never get to run if short processes keep arriving.

---
#### 3. Priority Scheduling

- **How it works**: Each process is assigned a priority number. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.
- **Type**: Can be both Non-Preemptive and Preemptive.
- SJF can be considered a special case of priority scheduling where the priority is the inverse of the next CPU burst time.

Major Drawback (Starvation / Indefinite Blocking):

A low-priority process might never execute if there is a steady stream of higher-priority processes.

Solution: Aging

Aging is a technique to gradually increase the priority of processes that have been waiting in the system for a long time. Eventually, the low-priority process will have its priority raised high enough to be scheduled.

---

#### 4. Round Robin (RR)

- **How it works**: Designed specifically for time-sharing systems. It is similar to FCFS but with preemption. A small unit of time, called a **time quantum** or **time slice** (typically 10-100 ms), is defined.
- The ready queue is treated as a circular queue. The scheduler goes around the queue, allocating the CPU to each process for a time interval of up to 1 time quantum.
- **Type**: Preemptive.

**Example Execution (Gantt Chart with Time Quantum = 3ms):**

1. P1 starts. Runs for 3ms. P1 has 4ms left. P1 goes to the back of the queue.
2. Queue: P2, P3, P4, P1. P2 runs for 3ms. P2 has 1ms left. P2 goes to the back.
3. Queue: P3, P4, P1, P2. P3 runs. Its burst (1ms) is less than the quantum, so it runs for 1ms and terminates.
4. Queue: P4, P1, P2. P4 runs for 3ms. P4 has 1ms left. P4 goes to the back.
5. Queue: P1, P2, P4. P1 runs for 3ms. P1 has 1ms left. P1 goes to the back.
6. Queue: P2, P4, P1. P2 runs for 1ms and terminates.
7. Queue: P4, P1. P4 runs for 1ms and terminates.
8. Queue: P1. P1 runs for 1ms and terminates.

```
| P1(3) | P2(3) |P3(1)| P4(3) | P1(3) | P2(1) | P4(1) | P1(1) |
0       3       6      7       10      13      14      15      16
```

- **Analysis**:
    
    - **Performance depends heavily on the size of the time quantum.**
    - **If quantum is too large**: RR behaves like FCFS.
    - **If quantum is too small**: The overhead of context switching becomes too high, reducing efficiency. The quantum should be large compared to the context switch time.
    - RR gives excellent response time, making it ideal for interactive systems.

### Scheduling Metrics

- **Burst Time (BT)**: The amount of CPU time a process requires to complete. (Given)
- **Arrival Time (AT)**: The time at which a process enters the Ready queue. (Given)
- **Completion Time (CT)**: The time at which a process finishes its execution. (Determined from the Gantt Chart)
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: The total time a process spends in the system, from arrival to completion.
    - **Formula**:
        TAT=Completion Time−Arrival Time
- **Waiting Time (WT)**: The total time a process spends waiting in the Ready queue.
    - **Formula**:
        WT=Turnaround Time−Burst Time
- **Response Time (RT)**: The time from when a process arrives until it gets the CPU for the _first time_.
    - **Formula**:
        RT=Time of First CPU Allocation−Arrival Time

|P4|5|4|16|16 - 5 = 11|11 - 4 = 7|
|**Average**||||**8.75**|**4.75**|

2. Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)

Gantt Chart: | P1 (7) | P3 (1) | P2 (4) | P4 (4) |

(0 -> 7 -> 8 -> 12 -> 16)

3. Preemptive SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)

Gantt Chart: | P1(2) | P2(2) | P3(1) | P2(2) | P4(4) | P1(5) |

(0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> 16)

|Process|AT|BT|CT|TAT (CT - AT)|WT (TAT - BT)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

4. Round Robin (RR) with Time Quantum = 3

Gantt Chart: | P1(3) | P2(3) | P3(1) | P4(3) | P1(3) | P2(1) | P4(1) | P1(1) |

(0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 10 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16)

|Process|AT|BT|CT|TAT (CT - AT)|WT (TAT - BT)|RT (Start - AT)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|P1|0|7|16|16 - 0 = 16|16 - 7 = 9|0 - 0 = 0|
|P2|2|4|14|14 - 2 = 12|12 - 4 = 8|3 - 2 = 1|

### Summary of Averages

|Algorithm|Average Turnaround Time|Average Waiting Time|
|---|---|---|
|FCFS|8.75|4.75|
|Non-Preemptive SJF|8.0|4.0|
|**Preemptive SJF (SRTF)**|**7.0**|**3.0**|
|Round Robin (Q=3)|10.25|6.25|

As you can see from the summary, **Preemptive SJF (SRTF)** provides the optimal (lowest) average turnaround and waiting times for this set of processes, which is consistent with the theory. Round Robin, while having higher average TAT and WT in this case, would provide the best average Response Time, making it feel more interactive to a user.
