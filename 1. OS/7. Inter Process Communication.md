**Inter-Process Communication** refers to the set of mechanisms provided by an operating system that allow independent processes to communicate and synchronize their actions. This is essential for building complex, modular applications where tasks are divided among multiple processes.

**Why is IPC needed?**

- **Modularity**: Structuring a system as a set of cooperating processes (e.g., a web server where one process listens for connections and hands them off to other worker processes).
- **Information Sharing**: Allowing different processes to access a common piece of data.
- **Computational Speedup**: Breaking a single task into multiple sub-tasks that can be run in parallel by different processes.

There are two primary models for IPC:

1. **Shared Memory**: Processes share a common region of memory. Communication is very fast as data doesn't need to be passed through the kernel. However, the programmer is responsible for providing synchronization (e.g., using mutexes or semaphores) to prevent race conditions.
2. **Message Passing**: Processes communicate by exchanging messages. The OS kernel provides `send` and `receive` functions. This is generally easier to implement correctly but is slower due to the overhead of kernel involvement (system calls).

### Common IPC Mechanisms in Linux

Here are the most common IPC mechanisms you should be familiar with, especially in a Linux environment.

#### 1. Pipes

A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel where data written to one end is read from the other. Think of it as a water pipe.
- **Anonymous Pipes**: These are unnamed and can only be used for communication between related processes (e.g., a parent and its child). They are created using the `pipe()` system call and cease to exist when the processes terminate.
    **Diagram: Anonymous Pipe**

- **Named Pipes (FIFO)**: These are represented by a special file in the file system. This allows unrelated processes to communicate with each other simply by knowing the name of the pipe file.

Code: This program creates a pipe, then forks. The parent process writes a message to the pipe, and the child process reads it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int pipefd[2]; // pipefd[0] is for reading, pipefd[1] is for writing
    char buffer[100];
    char* message = "Hello from Parent!";

    if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        return 1;
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork");
        return 1;
    }

    if (pid > 0) { // Parent process
        close(pipefd[0]); // Close the unused read end
        printf("Parent: Writing to pipe...\n");
        write(pipefd[1], message, strlen(message) + 1);
        close(pipefd[1]); // Close the write end
        wait(NULL); // Wait for child to finish
    } else { // Child process
        close(pipefd[1]); // Close the unused write end
        printf("Child: Reading from pipe...\n");
        read(pipefd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        printf("Child: Received message: \"%s\"\n", buffer);
        close(pipefd[0]); // Close the read end
    }
    return 0;
}
```
#### 2. Shared Memory

This is the fastest IPC method. The OS establishes a region of memory that is mapped into the virtual address space of two or more cooperating processes.

- **Mechanism**: One process creates a shared memory segment. Other processes can then "attach" to this segment. Once attached, the processes can read and write to this memory as if it were their own.
- **Crucial Point**: The OS provides **no synchronization**. The programmer must use semaphores or mutexes to protect the shared data from race conditions.
    **Diagram: Shared Memory**
    ![[Pasted image 20250717023312.png]]

Code: This example shows a parent process writing to shared memory and a child process reading from it.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    const int SIZE = 4096;
    const char* name = "OS_SHARED_MEM";
    const char* message = "Hello from Shared Memory!";

    int shm_fd;
    void* ptr;

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork");
        return 1;
    }
    
    if (pid > 0) { // Parent process (Writer)
        // Create the shared memory segment
        shm_fd = shm_open(name, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666);
        ftruncate(shm_fd, SIZE);

        // Map the shared memory segment to the process's address space
        ptr = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);

        // Write to shared memory
        sprintf(ptr, "%s", message);
        printf("Parent: Wrote to shared memory.\n");
        
        wait(NULL); // Wait for child
        
        // Unlink the shared memory segment
        shm_unlink(name);
    } else { // Child process (Reader)
        sleep(1); // Wait for parent to create and write
        
        // Open the shared memory segment
        shm_fd = shm_open(name, O_RDONLY, 0666);

        // Map the shared memory segment
        ptr = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, shm_fd, 0);
        
        // Read from shared memory
        printf("Child: Read from shared memory: \"%s\"\n", (char*)ptr);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Message Queues

A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel. It provides a structured way for processes to communicate.

- **Mechanism**: A process can add a message to the queue, and another process can retrieve it. Unlike pipes, this is not necessarily a direct stream. Messages can be prioritized or filtered by type.
- **Use Case**: It's useful when you want to send data in discrete packets (messages) rather than a continuous byte stream. For example, one process sends error reports as messages, and a logger process reads and processes them from the queue.
    **Diagram: Message Queue**

Code: This example demonstrates sending and receiving a message between a parent and child process.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <mqueue.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

#define QUEUE_NAME  "/my_test_queue"
#define MAX_SIZE    1024
#define MSG_STOP    "exit"

int main() {
    mqd_t mq;
    char buffer[MAX_SIZE];
    struct mq_attr attr;

    // Set message queue attributes
    attr.mq_flags = 0;
    attr.mq_maxmsg = 10;
    attr.mq_msgsize = MAX_SIZE;
    attr.mq_curmsgs = 0;

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork");
        return 1;
    }
    
    if (pid > 0) { // Parent process (Sender)
        // Open the message queue
        mq = mq_open(QUEUE_NAME, O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0644, &attr);
        
        char* message = "Hello from Message Queue!";
        printf("Parent: Sending message...\n");
        mq_send(mq, message, strlen(message) + 1, 0);

        wait(NULL); // Wait for the child to finish
        mq_close(mq);
        mq_unlink(QUEUE_NAME); // Clean up the queue
    } else { // Child process (Receiver)
        sleep(1); // Wait for parent to create queue
        
        // Open the message queue
        mq = mq_open(QUEUE_NAME, O_RDONLY);

        ssize_t bytes_read = mq_receive(mq, buffer, MAX_SIZE, NULL);
        buffer[bytes_read] = '\0';
        printf("Child: Received message: \"%s\"\n", buffer);
        
        mq_close(mq);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
